</hgroup>
<p class="noindent">In <a href="part_1.xhtml">Parts One</a> through <a href="part_3.xhtml">Three</a> of this book, we studied the transformation of inequality regimes from premodern trifunctional and slave societies into today’s hypercapitalist and postcommunist societies, with proprietarian, colonial, social-democratic, and/or communist societies as intermediate stages. In each instance I emphasized the political-ideological dimension of the transformation. Each inequality regime is associated with a corresponding theory of justice. Inequalities need to be justified; they must rest on a plausible, coherent vision of an ideal political and social organization. Every society therefore needs to answer a series of conceptual and practical questions about the boundaries of the community, the organization of property relations, access to education, and the apportionment of taxes. The answers given to these questions in the past were not always robust. Most have not withstood the test of time and have been replaced by other answers. It would nevertheless be wrong to think that today’s ideologies, based in one way or another on the sacralization of financial opacity and merited wealth, are any less outlandish or more likely to last.</p>
<p>In the age of representative democracy and universal suffrage, political-ideological conflicts around the question of just inequality continue. Criticism can be expressed through demonstrations and revolutions, or it can be couched in pamphlets and books. But conflict can also be expressed at the ballot box: people vote for different political parties and coalitions, depending on their worldviews and socioeconomic positions. Some also choose not to vote, which is in itself a declaration. Elections leave clues about people’s political beliefs and their evolution. These clues are often ambiguous and hard to interpret, but still, voting records provide richer and more systematic information than one finds in societies where there are no elections.</p>
<p>In <a href="part_4.xhtml">Part Four</a> we are going to study precisely this type of information. In particular, we are going to analyze the way in which the “classist” structure of political and electoral cleavages was radically transformed between the <span aria-label="720" id="pg_720" role="doc-pagebreak"/>social-democratic era (1950–1980) and the hypercapitalist and postcolonial era (1990–2020). In the first period, the least favored classes <i>(classes populaires)</i><sup><a href="#footnote-1461" id="footnote-1461-backlink" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> identified with parties of the broad left, whether Socialist, Communist, Labour, Democratic, or Social Democratic. This ceased to be the case in the second period, during which left-wing political parties and movements became parties of the educated; in some places they are also becoming the parties of voters with higher incomes and greater wealth.<sup><a href="#footnote-1460" id="footnote-1460-backlink" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> This evolution reflects the failure of the postwar social-democratic coalition to update its political agenda, specifically in regard to fiscal, educational, and international issues. It also shows that egalitarian coalitions are complex political-ideological constructs. Numerous social and ideological cleavages, beginning with conflicts about boundaries and property, always divide electorates. It is not easy to overcome these divisions and unite less advantaged voters with different histories and backgrounds (urban and rural, salaried and self-employed, native and immigrant, etc.) unless specific sociohistorical and political-ideological conditions are met.</p>
<p>In this chapter we will begin by studying the case of France. In subsequent chapters we will look first at the United States and United Kingdom and then at other representative democracies in Western and Eastern Europe, as well as non-Western cases such as India and Brazil. Comparing the different trajectories of each of these countries will help us to understand why these changes occurred and give us insight into possible future dynamics. We will also look at an important recent development: social nativism, which is a consequence of postcommunist disillusionment, inadequate reflection on the structure of globalization, and the difficulty of accommodating to postcolonial diversity. Social nativism is a trap. Under what conditions can it be avoided? One way of coping with this new identitarian threat might be to work toward what I call social federalism and participatory socialism. We will consider both in the final chapters.</p>

<h1 class="head a-head"><a id="sec207"/><span aria-label="721" id="pg_721" role="doc-pagebreak"/><i>Deconstructing Left and Right: The Dimensions of Sociopolitical Conflict</i></h1>
<p class="noindent">There are many reasons why electoral and political cleavages can never be reduced to a single dimension, such as an opposition between “poor” and “rich.” In the first place, political conflict is above all ideological, not “classist.” It opposes worldviews—systems of beliefs about a just society, which cannot be reduced to individual socioeconomic characteristics or class membership. For a given set of individual attributes, there will always exist a wide variety of possible opinions, which will be influenced by individual and family histories, encounters and exchanges, reading, reflection, and subjective responses. “What is the ideal organization of society?” is too complicated a question to allow a deterministic relation between “class position” and political beliefs. Of course, I do not mean to say that political beliefs are entirely arbitrary. On the contrary, I am convinced that history has much to teach us about the shape of an ideal property or tax regime or educational system. But these issues are so complex that the only hope of real and lasting progress is through collective deliberation in which the variety of individual experiences and ideas of the just society are represented, and these can never be reduced to class position. The way in which organizations such as political parties and movements, trade unions, and other associations translate individual aspirations to equality and emancipation into political programs plays a crucial role in determining how individuals participate and engage in politics.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the very notion of social class must be seen as profoundly multidimensional. It involves every aspect of a person’s occupation: the sector and status of the work, wages and other forms of labor income, skills, professional identity, hierarchical position, and ability to take part in decision making and in the organization of production. Class also depends on levels of training and education, which partly determine access to different occupations, forms of political participation, and social interactions and, along with family and personal networks, help to determine cultural and symbolic capital. Finally, social class is closely related to wealth. Today as in the past, whether or not one owns real estate or professional or financial assets has numerous consequences. For instance, it determines whether one must devote an important part of one’s lifetime income to paying rent, which other people collect. Property ownership also implies the ability to purchase goods and services produced by others, which is yet another important determinant of social class; indeed, wealth is a determinant of social power in general. For instance, it has a direct impact on <span aria-label="722" id="pg_722" role="doc-pagebreak"/>one’s ability to start a business and hire other people to work in a hierarchical and asymmetrical setting toward the realization of a plan. Wealth also enables individuals to support the projects of others and perhaps even to influence politics by financing parties and/or news media.</p>
<p>Apart from occupation, education, and wealth, the social class with which an individual identifies may also be influenced by age, gender, (real or perceived) national or ethnic origin, and religious, philosophical, dietary, or sexual orientation. Class position is also characterized by level of income, which is a complex and composite attribute since it depends on all the other dimensions. In particular, income includes both labor income (wage and nonwage) and capital income (rent, interest, dividends, capital gains, profits, etc.). It therefore depends on occupation, level of education, and property, especially since wealth, which can be used to pay for education and training or to finance professional investments, partly determines access to certain occupations and therefore to income from those occupations.</p>

<p>This multidimensionality of social cleavages is essential for understanding the evolution the political and electoral cleavage structure (<a href="chapter_14.xhtml#fig14-1">Figs. 14.1</a>–<a href="chapter_14.xhtml#fig14-2">14.2</a>). To <span aria-label="723" id="pg_723" role="doc-pagebreak"/>begin, consider voting patterns in the social-democratic era—roughly 1950–1980. In nearly all Western countries, the various dimensions of social cleavage were politically aligned. In other words, people at the bottom of the social hierarchy tended to vote for socialist, communist, or (broadly) social-democratic parties or movements, regardless of the dimension considered (education, income, or wealth); furthermore, occupying a low rank in several dimensions had a cumulative effect on one’s vote. This was true not only for explicitly social-democratic parties such as the German Social Democratic Party (SPD) or Swedish Social Democratic Party (SAP) but also for the Labour vote in the United Kingdom and the Democratic vote in the United States, as well as for left-wing parties of various stripes (Socialist, Communist, Radical, or Green) in countries where the left was historically divided into several parties, such as in France.<sup><a href="#footnote-1459" id="footnote-1459-backlink" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> In contrast, the vote for the Republican Party in the United States, the Conservative Party in the United Kingdom, and various parties of the right and center-right in other countries was larger among the more highly educated, higher paid, and wealthier, with cumulative effects for voters highly placed along all three axes.</p>

</figure>
<p><span aria-label="724" id="pg_724" role="doc-pagebreak"/>The structure of political conflict in the period 1950–1980 was “classist” in the sense that it pitted less advantaged social classes against more advantaged social classes, regardless of the axis considered. In contrast, political conflict in the period 1990–2020 involves a system of multiple elites: one coalition is backed by the more highly educated while the other enjoys the support of the wealthiest and highest paid (although less and less clearly, as elites transition from the latter coalition to the former). Note, moreover, that in all countries in the classist era we find a very clear gradation in the degree of political cleavage associated with the three dimensions of social stratification. Wealth is the most divisive dimension: people without property voted heavily for social-democratic (or equivalent) parties, while conversely, wealthy people rarely did. Education exerted a similar influence in the period 1950–1980 but to a significantly smaller degree: the less well educated were more likely to vote for social-democratic (or equivalent) parties, while the opposite was true for the better educated, but the gap was much less pronounced than in the case of wealth. Logically enough, income fell between these two extremes: it was less divisive than wealth but more divisive than education.</p>
<p>This gradation in the degree of politicization of these three dimensions of social cleavage is clearly visible in the case of France (<a href="chapter_14.xhtml#fig14-1">Fig. 14.1</a>); it also exists in all the other countries studied. In the French case, if we look at the percentage of people voting for parties of the left among the wealthiest 10 percent and the poorest 90 percent of the population, we find a very marked gap on the order of 25 percentage points for the period 1950–1980. Take, for instance, the French presidential election of 1974. After a very tight election campaign in a period of great social turmoil, the candidate of the Union of the Left, Fran<span class="accent">ç</span>ois Mitterrand, narrowly lost in the second round with 49 percent of the vote, compared with 51 percent for his right-wing opponent, Val<span class="accent">é</span>ry Giscard d’Estaing. Mitterrand won nearly 52 percent of the votes of people in the bottom 90 percent of the wealth distribution, however, compared with just 27 percent of the votes of the top 10 percent—a gap of twenty-five points.</p>
<p>If we now look at the percentage of people voting for the same parties among the top 10 and bottom 90 percent of the income distribution (as opposed to the wealth distribution), we find a gap of 10 to 15 percentage points in the pe<span aria-label="725" id="pg_725" role="doc-pagebreak"/>riod 1950–1980. Although this is a large difference in absolute terms, the income effect is nevertheless smaller than the wealth effect.<sup><a href="#footnote-1458" id="footnote-1458-backlink" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></p>

<h1 class="head a-head"><a id="sec208"/><i>The Left-Wing Vote Since 1945: From the Workers’ Party to the Party of the Educated</i></h1>
<p class="noindent">It is quite striking to discover that the educational effect has completely reversed since 1980. In the 1950s and 1960s, the vote for left-wing parties was significantly smaller among the 10 percent of the population with the highest levels of education than among the 90 percent with the lowest. Over the next two decades the size of this gap diminished, however, and then it changed sign. In the 1990s and 2000s, the vote for left-wing parties was significantly higher among the best educated 10 percent than among the less well-educated 90 percent, again with a gap of 10–15 percentage points but in the opposite direction (<a href="chapter_14.xhtml#fig14-1">Fig. 14.1</a>).</p>
<p>In short, in the postwar years, the people who voted left were likely to be less well-educated salaried workers, but over the past half century this has changed, and they now are more likely to be people with higher levels of education, including managers and people in intellectual professions.</p>
<p>In this and subsequent chapters, I will try to document this radical transformation in greater detail and above all try to understand its origins, significance, and consequences. At this stage, several points need to be made explicit. First, this same basic structure of political conflict (with an identical gradation of wealth, income, and educational effects) and same basic evolution since World War II are found in all Western democracies, including the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, and Sweden (with variants that we will examine). For instance, in regard to the United States, if one looks at the gap in the vote for the Democratic Party between the best educated 10 percent and the remaining 90 percent, one finds approximately the same evolution as in the vote for left-wing parties in France (<a href="chapter_14.xhtml#fig14-2">Fig. 14.2</a>). The same is true of the Labour vote in the United Kingdom. The British seem to have lagged slightly behind France and the United States (see below), but ultimately the basic pattern is identical. Labour, which long identified itself as the workers’ party, has de facto become the party of the educated, whom it attracts in greater number than the Tories. Michael Young, <span aria-label="726" id="pg_726" role="doc-pagebreak"/>as prescient as he was in <i>The Rise of Meritocracy</i> (published in 1958), nevertheless failed to anticipate such a complete reversal.<sup><a href="#footnote-1457" id="footnote-1457-backlink" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup></p>
<p>It is particularly striking to note the similarity of the change in the United States and Europe, given that the political-ideological origins of the party systems are totally different. In the United States, the Democratic Party was the party of slavery and segregation before it became the party of the New Deal, greater socioeconomic equality, and civil rights. From the end of the Civil War on, the transformation was gradual and steady, without a sharp break.<sup><a href="#footnote-1456" id="footnote-1456-backlink" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> By contrast, in Europe, the various left-wing parties were in one way or another the heirs of socialist, communist, or social-democratic traditions and ideologies, committed to one degree or another to collectivization of the means of production. Furthermore, the socioeconomic contexts in which they competed were virtually devoid of racial and ethnic divisions (at least within Europe, not including the colonies). In Europe, moreover, there was diversity among left-wing parties. For instance, in France, there was a sharp division between the anti-Soviet Socialist Party and the pro-Soviet Communist Party. In Britain, the Labour Party was unified and for a long time favorable to nationalizations while in Sweden and Germany the social-democratic parties had long since converted to co-management.<sup><a href="#footnote-1455" id="footnote-1455-backlink" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup> Despite all these differences, we find a similar pattern of evolution in all cases, and this calls for explanation.</p>
<p>Indeed, the similarity of trajectories across countries suggests that any narrowly national hypothesis should be viewed with a skeptical eye. More global explanations, based in particular on the reasons why members of less favored social groups increasingly feel less well represented (not to say abandoned) by the electoral left, are a priori more plausible. Specifically, I have in mind the inability of (broadly) social-democratic postwar coalitions to update their programs sufficiently, particularly in regard to developing convincing norms of justice adapted to the age of globalization and higher education. The shift in the global ideological climate that followed the failure of communism in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe also seems to have been an important factor in this change, owing to a certain disillusionment with the very idea that a more just economy and a real and durable reduction of inequality were even possible.</p>
<p>In dealing with such complex changes, however, it is impossible to rule out a priori many other potential explanations, such as the growing importance of <span aria-label="727" id="pg_727" role="doc-pagebreak"/>new cultural, racial, or immigration-related cleavages in postcolonial societies. To understand these transformations, we must carefully examine the trajectory of change in each country, being careful not to exaggerate our ability to imagine how things might have taken a different course.</p>

<section epub:type="division">
<h1 class="head a-head"><a id="sec209"/><i>Toward a Global Study of Electoral and Political-Ideological Cleavages</i></h1>
<p class="noindent">Before proceeding further, I should say a bit more about the sources on which this type of analysis is based and acknowledge their limits as well as their strengths. The results shown in <a href="chapter_14.xhtml#fig14-1">Figs. 14.1</a>–<a href="chapter_14.xhtml#fig14-2">14.2</a> and the other graphs in this and subsequent chapters are the fruit of joint research based on an original and systematic exploitation of postelection survey data in a variety of countries over the past several decades. These surveys were generally conducted by consortia of universities and research centers, in some cases in conjunction with the media, to study electoral behavior. Representative samples of the population were questioned about their votes and motivations, usually in the days following an election. The surveys included questions about individual sociodemographic and economic characteristics: age, sex, place of residence, occupation, sector of employment, level of education, income, assets, religious practice, origins, and so on. These instruments thus offer direct evidence of the socioeconomic structure of the electorate in each country and how it changed over time.</p>
<p>The sources suffer from a number of shortcomings, however. First, postelection surveys are a relatively recent invention. In particular, they do not allow us to study elections prior to World War II. We will begin with detailed studies of the United States, France, and the United Kingdom, where fairly elaborate surveys have been conducted since the late 1940s or early 1950s. The records are sufficiently well preserved to allow satisfactory analysis of the structure of the electorate for nearly all US presidential elections since 1948 and all British and French legislative elections since 1955 or 1956.<sup><a href="#footnote-1454" id="footnote-1454-backlink" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> Comparable surveys have <span aria-label="728" id="pg_728" role="doc-pagebreak"/>also been conducted in Germany and Sweden since the 1950s as well as in most European and non-European representative democracies (including India, Japan, Canada, and Australia) since the 1960s or 1970s. In the new democracies of Eastern Europe, it is possible to study the evolution of electoral cleavages since the 1990s or 2000s. In Brazil, one can do the same from the fall of the military dictatorship and return to elections in the late 1980s. In South Africa, surveys begin in the mid-1990s with the fall of apartheid. Clearly, then, with postelection surveys it is possible to work one’s way around the world.<sup><a href="#footnote-1453" id="footnote-1453-backlink" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup> However, the available data do not allow us to study elections from the nineteenth or first half of the twentieth centuries, for which other methods and materials are needed.<sup><a href="#footnote-1452" id="footnote-1452-backlink" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup></p>
<p>The other import limitation of the survey-based method is the limited sample size (generally around 4,000–5,000 people for each sample). This technical point is important: it implies that we cannot use this source to study small variations from election to election because these are generally too small <span aria-label="729" id="pg_729" role="doc-pagebreak"/>to be statistically significant. By contrast, the long-term evolutions on which we will concentrate here are very significant, as the confidence intervals shown in <a href="chapter_14.xhtml#fig14-1">Fig. 14.1</a> indicate.<sup><a href="#footnote-1451" id="footnote-1451-backlink" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup> In particular, the complete reversal of the educational cleavage between the two periods, 1950–1980 and 1990–2020, in which the left goes from being the choice of the less educated to that of the better educated, is extremely significant, not just in France but everywhere. The samples are also large enough to allow reasoning in terms of “all other things being equal.” In other words, we can isolate the effects of education by controlling for the effects of other individual attributes, which are often correlated with education (but not systematically).<sup><a href="#footnote-1450" id="footnote-1450-backlink" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup> Note, too, of course, that election surveys, like any source involving self-declared information, may suffer from biases in the answers given by respondents. Specifically, we often find a slight overrepresentation of responses in favor of winning parties and coalitions as well as a slight underrepresentation of the vote for minority or stigmatized political movements (or movements perceived as such).<sup><a href="#footnote-1449" id="footnote-1449-backlink" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup> Nevertheless, there is no reason to think that these biases affect vote differentials between social groups, much less the evolution of these differentials over time, which recur in survey after survey and country after country and therefore appear to be well established.<sup><a href="#footnote-1448" id="footnote-1448-backlink" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup></p>
<p><span aria-label="730" id="pg_730" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Note, moreover, that <a href="chapter_14.xhtml#fig14-1">Figs. 14.1</a>–<a href="chapter_14.xhtml#fig14-2">14.2</a> focus on a specific indicator (namely, the vote differential between the top 10 percent and the bottom 90 percent), but the evolutions would be similar if one measured the cleavages with a different indicator, such as the 50 percent best educated compared to the 50 percent least well educated (and the same for income and wealth). Or one could compare those with college degrees to those without or those with high school diplomas to those without.<sup><a href="#footnote-1447" id="footnote-1447-backlink" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup></p>
<p>In short, despite their limitations, postelection surveys confirm the robustness of the results shown in <a href="chapter_14.xhtml#fig14-1">Figs. 14.1</a>–<a href="chapter_14.xhtml#fig14-2">14.2</a>. I will return to this point when I discuss the detailed results for France, the United States, United Kingdom, and other countries.</p>
<p>The surveys and results discussed thus far also enable us to determine the degree to which the three dimensions of social stratification are correlated. Note that the correlation is not systematic: there are always people with a high level of education but not much wealth, for instance, while others with little education may be quite wealthy. Social classes constitute a multidimensional space. Of course, there is a central diagonal consisting of groups disadvantaged or advantaged on all axes at once (to the extent that individual attributes can be ordered vertically, which is not always the case). But class is a complex phenomenon resulting from many different trajectories. Individuals can occupy different positions on different axes (sometimes only slightly different, sometimes more so). In every society, these differences of position, combined with differences of trajectory, belief, and representations for a given social position, define a complex, multidimensional social space. If the three dimensions considered here (education, income, and wealth) were perfectly correlated, then by definition it would be impossible to present results like those shown in <a href="chapter_14.xhtml#fig14-1">Fig. 14.1</a>: all three curves would coincide exactly. According to the postelection survey data, the correlation among these three dimensions seems to have remained roughly constant over the entire period 1950–2020 (with perhaps a slight increase toward the end of the period, as far as one can judge on the basis of imperfect data).<sup><a href="#footnote-1446" id="footnote-1446-backlink" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup> In other words, the evolutions in question cannot be explained <span aria-label="731" id="pg_731" role="doc-pagebreak"/>by a sudden decrease in the correlation of education, income, and wealth. The important change is therefore political-ideological in nature (rather than socioeconomic). It is related primarily to the ability of political organizations and electoral coalitions to unite or divide the various dimensions of social inequality.</p>

<h1 class="head a-head"><a id="sec210"/><i>Internationalizing the Study of Ethno-Racial Cleavages and Social Nativism</i></h1>
<p class="noindent">Note, finally, that the results presented here build upon an important body of work in political science. In the 1960s, the political scientists Seymour Martin Lipset and Stein Rokkan proposed a multidimensional analysis of electoral cleavages as a way of analyzing party systems and their evolution. They argued that modern societies began with two great revolutions: the national revolution (which led to the construction of nation-states with centralized governments) and the industrial revolution. Out of these two revolutions came four major political cleavages, whose relative salience varied from country to country: (1) a cleavage between center and periphery (central regions or areas close to the capital and regions perceived as peripheral); (2) a cleavage between the central government and churches; (3) a cleavage between agricultural and industrial sectors; and (4) a cleavage related to ownership of the means of production, pitting workers against employers and owners.<sup><a href="#footnote-1445" id="footnote-1445-backlink" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup></p>
<p>For instance, Lipset and Rokkan used these ideas to explain the British party system circa 1750, which pitted Tories (conservatives) against Whigs (liberals). The former were rural, landed elites jealous of their local power while the latter were urban business elites more reliant on the central state. This battle unfolded in an era when only a few percent of the population enjoyed the right to vote, so that the only form political and electoral conflict could take was between elites. The advent of universal suffrage and the industrial cleavage led to the <span aria-label="732" id="pg_732" role="doc-pagebreak"/>replacement of the Whig Party (which became the Liberal Party in 1859) by the Labour Party between 1900 and 1950.<sup><a href="#footnote-1444" id="footnote-1444-backlink" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup> Lipset and Rokkan also insist on the importance of religious and educational issues in the constitution of European party systems in the nineteenth and first half of the twentieth centuries: proponents of a secular state clashed, often violently, with defenders of a continuing role for ecclesiastical institutions (especially in France, Italy, and Spain). In most countries this had a lasting impact on party structures (with separate Protestant and Catholic parties emerging in some countries, such as Germany and the Netherlands). The cleavages studied by Lipset and Rokkan continue to play an important role to this day.</p>
<p>The approach developed here differs from theirs, however, in two essential details. First, with the advantage of hindsight and recently available sources, I have been able to identify profound transformations in the structure of electoral and sociopolitical cleavages that have taken place since the 1950s. To pinpoint these changes, I propose to classify voters by their position in the educational, income, and wealth hierarchies and to make systematic use of the postelection surveys that have been conducted regularly since 1945. Of course, deciles of education, income, or wealth do not translate directly into social and class identities as they manifest themselves in politics and history. But just as with the measurement of inequality, this terminology has the advantage of allowing comparison of electoral cleavages in very different types of society over long periods of time. In other words, educational, income, and wealth deciles make precise historical comparisons possible, whereas occupational classifications do not (because they change significantly over time).<sup><a href="#footnote-1443" id="footnote-1443-backlink" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup></p>
<p>Second, one limitation of the framework proposed by Lipset and Rokkan is that it completely ignores the question of ethno-racial cleavages. This may seem paradoxical, since their work was published in the 1960s, at the height of the civil rights battle in the United States. Contrary to what may have been <span aria-label="733" id="pg_733" role="doc-pagebreak"/>thought at the time, this dimension of political conflict has not disappeared.<sup><a href="#footnote-1442" id="footnote-1442-backlink" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup> It has actually grown stronger, both in the United States where the race factor is often cited as a reason for the gradual shift of the white working-class vote from the Democratic to the Republican Party in the half century since the 1960s and in Europe where conflicts over issues of identity and immigration have taken on new salience since the rise of anti-immigrant parties since the 1980s and 1990s. All too often studies of these issues focus separately on either Europe or the United States. Work on the US party system tends to concentrate exclusively on what is happening there (which unfortunately is true of much work in the United States in general).<sup><a href="#footnote-1441" id="footnote-1441-backlink" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup> Research on Europe is similarly skewed, probably in part because the US party system seems radically different and therefore undecipherable or at any rate hard to compare.<sup><a href="#footnote-1440" id="footnote-1440-backlink" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup> European observers never cease to be amazed that the pro-slavery party of the nineteenth century gradually turned into the New Deal party of Roosevelt in the twentieth century and then into the party of Barack Obama in the twenty-first century, and some worry about the significance of that history and its possible implications.</p>
<p>Comparative analysis of the role of ethno-racial cleavages in Europe and the United States (as well as in several non-Western democracies) can nevertheless clarify the evolution of political cleavages on both sides of the Atlantic and shed light on possible future trajectories. In particular, this approach will enable us to analyze the risk of a social-nativist turn in various countries and <span aria-label="734" id="pg_734" role="doc-pagebreak"/>to study the conditions under which socioeconomic cleavages may regain their ascendancy over ethno-racial conflict.</p>

<h1 class="head a-head"><a id="sec211"/><i>Renewal of Political Parties, Declining Electoral Participation</i></h1>
<p class="noindent">Let us turn again to the case of France and the transformation of the French electorate since the end of World War II. We will be looking at both legislative and presidential elections. From 1871 to the present, there have been legislative elections in France at roughly five-year intervals, first under universal male suffrage and then, since 1944, under universal suffrage. Compared with the United States and United Kingdom, France stands out for the very large number of its political parties and more or less permanent transformation of party structures. In the United States, a two-party system—Democrats versus Republicans—has dominated since the middle of the nineteenth century, although within each party there have always been many factions. Candidates are selected by a system of primaries, and there have been deep and lasting transformations of the ideological orientations of each bloc. In the United Kingdom, the bipartite Liberal-Conservative system of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries was supplanted in 1945 by a bipartite Labour-Conservative system, again with numerous complications that I will discuss later coupled with profound ideological and programmatic changes. In practice, the contrast between the multipartite French system and the bipartite British and American systems has more to do with institutional differences rather than with the supposedly broader range of ideological diversity in France. Among those institutional differences are the respective electoral systems of each country, but one can of course see electoral systems themselves as reflections of different concepts of political pluralism and their embodiment in political parties.<sup><a href="#footnote-1439" id="footnote-1439-backlink" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup></p>
<p>Since my primary purpose here is to study the evolution of electoral and political-ideological cleavages in a long-term historical and comparative perspective, I will begin by focusing on the distribution of votes between two sets <span aria-label="735" id="pg_735" role="doc-pagebreak"/>of parties that took part in French legislative elections in the period 1945–2017. To simplify matters, I propose to call one group of parties the “electoral left” and the other the “electoral right” (<a href="chapter_14.xhtml#fig14-3">Fig. 14.3</a>). In the period that concerns me here, the electoral left included the Socialist, Communist, and Radical Parties, joined at times by an ecological party along with other small parties classified as center-left, left, or extreme left (<a href="chapter_14.xhtml#fig14-4">Fig. 14.4</a>). Similarly, the electoral right included the Gaullist party and various other political formations classified as center-right, right, or extreme right (<a href="chapter_14.xhtml#fig14-5">Fig. 14.5</a>). The justification for grouping parties in this way is that the goal is to compare the French cleavage structure with that observed in the two-party US and UK systems. I have simply classified the various French parties based on where voters place them on a left-right scale in postelection surveys, which I take to be the least arbitrary way of dividing the electorate into two roughly equal halves.<sup><a href="#footnote-1438" id="footnote-1438-backlink" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup> Furthermore, the results are consistent with the way the parties describe themselves. The only parties excluded from this classification are those that voters either refuse to place on a left-right scale or else rank inconsistently. In practice, these are small regionalist parties or single-issue parties (like the Hunters Party), which did not receive more than 4 percent of the vote in any legislative election, whereas the left and right blocs each received 40–58 percent (<a href="chapter_14.xhtml#fig14-3">Fig. 14.3</a>).<sup><a href="#footnote-1437" id="footnote-1437-backlink" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup></p>

</figure>
<p>It is important to note, however, that these categorizations are largely artificial. Within each broad party group there has always existed a very broad range of opinions and sensibilities (which is also true of the major British and American parties). In fact, the structure of political-ideological conflict is as a general rule highly multidimensional. In particular, there is disagreement about matters related to property (which include fiscal policy and other measures to reduce inequality) and to borders (including immigration policy). Of course, there are times when one dimension or another becomes the primary focus of electoral competition and therefore influences how voters perceive the relative positions of the parties. Because political-ideological is multidimensional and the dimensions are not perfectly correlated, equilibria are generally precarious, unstable, and temporary.</p>
<p>This is indeed the case in France today in the late 2010s. As we will see later, this is clearly a period in which the principal axis of electoral and political conflict is being redefined. One sign of this is the vehement rejection of <span aria-label="738" id="pg_738" role="doc-pagebreak"/>terminology related to old political cleavages (especially “left” and “right,” terms that are even more indignantly repudiated than usual—a sign that their meaning is shifting). To understand how we got to this point, however, it will be useful to begin by studying the evolution of the left-right cleavage in France since 1950 and to compare it with the Democratic-Republican and Labour-Conservative cleavages in the United States and United Kingdom.</p>
<p>Indeed, the designations “left” and “right” have always been a site of intense political-linguistic conflict. Some speakers use these words positively to define their own identities or pejoratively sense to discredit their enemies. Others reject them as no longer applicable (which does not prevent new axes of conflict from emerging). My goal here is not to settle disputes about terminology, police language, or expound the deep nature of the “authentic left” or “authentic right.” To do any of these things would make little sense, especially since “left” and “right” clearly have no fixed eternal meaning. They are sociohistorical constructs, which structure and organize political-ideological conflict and electoral competition in specific historical contexts. First used during the French Revolution to refer to political groups seated on the left and right sides of the chamber, specifically in relation to their position on the question of perpetuating or ending the monarchy, the notions of left and right have been the object of constant struggle and perpetual redefinition ever since. In particular, disputes over the meaning of left and right are likely to arise when there is disagreement about political strategies that claim to transcend the conflicts of the past and introduce new political cleavages. At this stage, my goal is simply to study the evolution of left and right as electoral descriptions. How have specific groups and parties embodied the notions of left and right in elections since the end of World War II? I will also compare the evolution of electoral cleavage structures across countries during this period.</p>
<p>It is also interesting to consider electoral behavior in the second rounds of those French presidential elections from 1965 to 2012 in which a candidate of the right faced a candidate of the left (<a href="chapter_14.xhtml#fig14-6">Fig. 14.6</a>). In these contests, voters faced a binary choice, which is perforce reductive but also revealing. It turns out that the results for presidential elections confirm those derived from legislative elections.<sup><a href="#footnote-1436" id="footnote-1436-backlink" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup> The latter have the advantage of extending over a longer <span aria-label="739" id="pg_739" role="doc-pagebreak"/>period and give a more accurate picture of the multiparty nature of French political life.<sup><a href="#footnote-1435" id="footnote-1435-backlink" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup></p>

<p class="CAP"><i>Interpretation:</i> The scores obtained in the second rounds of French presidential elections (where left faced right) are as follows: 1965 (De Gaulle 55 percent, Mitterand 45 percent), 1974 (Giscard 51 percent, Mitterrand 49 percent), 1981 (Mitterrand 52 percent, Giscard 48 percent), 1988 (Mitterrand 54 percent, Chirac 46 percent), 1995 (Chirac 53 percent, Jospin 47 percent), 2007 (Sarkozy 53 percent, Royal 47 percent), 2012 (Hollande 52 percent, Sarkozy 48 percent).

</figure>
<p>Finally, note that although French parties changed significantly, particularly toward the end of the period, voter turnout nevertheless decreased. In presidential elections the decrease is less noticeable: it fell from 80–85 percent in <span aria-label="740" id="pg_740" role="doc-pagebreak"/>the period 1965–2012 to 75 percent in 2017. The decrease was greater in legislative elections where the participation rate of 75–80 percent from the 1950s to the 1980s fell to 60–65 percent in the 2000s and to less than 50 percent in 2017 (<a href="chapter_14.xhtml#fig14-7">Fig. 14.7</a>).<sup><a href="#footnote-1434" id="footnote-1434-backlink" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup> Note that participation in general elections in the United Kingdom was also around 75–80 percent from the 1950s to the 1980s but fell quite rapidly in the 1990s (to about 60 percent in the early 2000s) and then climbed again in the 2010s (to almost 70 percent in 2017). In the United States, voter turnout has always been relatively low, so the decrease is less marked: it was about 60–65 percent in the 1950s and 1960s and has fluctuated around 50–55 percent since the 1970s.<sup><a href="#footnote-1433" id="footnote-1433-backlink" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup></p>

<h1 class="head a-head"><a id="sec212"/><span aria-label="741" id="pg_741" role="doc-pagebreak"/><i>On the Declining Turnout of the Less Advantaged Classes</i></h1>
<p class="noindent">The next point is especially important: it is striking to note that turnout rates are linked to inequality. Turnout remains high among socially advantaged voters but declines among less advantaged voters (<a href="chapter_14.xhtml#fig14-8">Fig. 14.8</a>). Using postelection surveys from the United States, United Kingdom, and France for the period 1948–2017, we can relate turnout rate to individual socioeconomic characteristics. In the United States, where overall turnout is generally low, we find that turnout has always been much higher among voters belonging to the top 50 percent of the income distribution compared with turnout among those in the bottom 50 percent; the gap has ranged from 12 to 20 percentage points over the past sixty years. We find a similar gap if we use level of education, occupation, or wealth. Whatever the criterion used, we find that abstention is higher among less advantaged groups.</p>
<p>In the United Kingdom and France between 1950 and 1980, turnout was high among all classes. Specifically, the difference between the turnout rate of those in the top 50 percent of the income distribution and those in the bottom 50 percent was barely 2–3 percentage points. In other words, all social categories voted at practically the same rate (close to 80 percent). By contrast, from the 1990s on, as overall turnout declined, we find that the social gap increased. In the 2010s, in both France and the United Kingdom, the gap between the turnout rate of the top 50 percent of the income distribution and that of the bottom 50 percent was 10–12 percentage points, a level approaching that of the United States (<a href="chapter_14.xhtml#fig14-8">Fig. 14.8</a>). Here again, we find similar gaps if we look at education, occupation, or wealth.<sup><a href="#footnote-1432" id="footnote-1432-backlink" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup></p>

<p class="CAP"><i>Interpretation:</i> In the period 1950–1970, voter turnout in France and the United Kingdom was barely 2–3 percent higher in the top 50 percent of the income distribution than in the bottom. This gap subsequently increased and attained 10–12 percent in the 2010s, approaching US levels. <i>Sources and series:</i> piketty.pse.ens.fr/ideology.</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p><span aria-label="742" id="pg_742" role="doc-pagebreak"/>I will come back to this declining turnout of the less advantaged classes, which is of central importance to the argument of this book. It has been quite persistent in the United States over the last half century. In France and the United Kingdom it first appeared in the period 1990–2020, following a period of relatively egalitarian voter turnout from 1950 to 1990. It is natural to interpret this change by positing that the less advantaged classes felt less well represented by the political parties and platforms on offer in the second period than in the first. In this connection, it is striking to note that the accession to power of Tony Blair’s “New Labour” in 1997–2010 and of the French Socialist Party in 1988–1993 and 1997–2002 coincided with a particularly sharp drop in the turnout of the less advantaged classes.</p>
<p>Note that the turnout rates given here are based on the number of registered voters (since the unregistered generally are not included in postelection surveys). Of those theoretically eligible to vote, as many as 10 percent commonly go unregistered, and this percentage is even higher among the less advantaged classes, especially African Americans in the United States, who are prevented from registering in some states by a variety of regulations and procedures (such as requirements to provide proof of identity or laws excluding convicted felons from the rolls).<sup><a href="#footnote-1431" id="footnote-1431-backlink" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup> The French postelection surveys for 2012 and <span aria-label="743" id="pg_743" role="doc-pagebreak"/>2017 include data from which it possible to demonstrate the existence of very large social biases regarding voter registration.<sup><a href="#footnote-1430" id="footnote-1430-backlink" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup></p>
<p>Ultimately, the declining turnout of the less advantaged classes in the period 1990–2020 illustrates one good aspect of the “classist” cleavage structure of the period 1950–1980. In the abstract, it is neither a good thing nor a bad thing that political conflict is organized along classist lines, in which one party or coalition attracts the votes of the least advantaged (on any dimension: education, income, or wealth) and the other attracts the votes of the more advantaged. One might even argue that an electoral system split along purely class lines suggest a certain failure of democracy. Elections in such a system come down to a clash of antagonistic interests and would no longer reflect a broad range of opinions and experiences.<sup><a href="#footnote-1429" id="footnote-1429-backlink" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup> Note, however, that the classist cleavages of the period 1950–1980 left a good deal of room for diverse individual trajectories and subjectivities: individuals with the lowest levels of education, income, and wealth tended on average to vote more often for parties of the left, but the relation was far from systematic.</p>
<p>Classist electoral conflict had at least one positive feature: it mobilized all social categories in equal proportions.<sup><a href="#footnote-1428" id="footnote-1428-backlink" role="doc-noteref">34</a></sup> Matters of redistribution were very much a part of political debate: this was the era of the welfare state, which put in place systems of social insurance and progressive taxation. Left and right <span aria-label="744" id="pg_744" role="doc-pagebreak"/>coalitions brought their different experiences and aspirations to the table. It would be na<span class="accent">ï</span>ve to describe the choices that emerged as fully democratic, because many asymmetries remained in the distribution of political power and influence. Still, all classes participated. By contrast, what has emerged in the period 1990–2020 is an electoral regime of competing elites. Social cleavages remain at the center of political conflict (because one coalition attracts the votes of the better educated while the other attracts the highest earners and wealthiest individuals), but debate about redistribution has largely been obliterated, and the less advantaged classes have substantially decreased their participation. This can hardly be seen as a positive development.</p>

<h1 class="head a-head"><a id="sec213"/><i>On the Reversal of the Educational Cleavage: The Invention of the Party of the Educated</i></h1>
<p class="noindent">We come now to what is surely the most striking evolution in the long run; namely, the transformation of the party of workers into the party of the educated. Before turning to explanations, it is important to emphasize that the reversal of the educational cleavage is a very general phenomenon. What is more, it is a complete reversal, visible at all levels of the educational hierarchy. Take, for example, the legislative elections of 1956, in which the parties of the left (Socialists, Communists, and Radicals) did extremely well in France, together capturing nearly 54 percent of the vote. Among voters without a diploma or whose highest diploma was an elementary school leaving certificate and who comprised 72 percent of the electorate at the time. The parties of the left captured an even higher portion of the vote—57 percent (<a href="chapter_14.xhtml#fig14-9">Fig. 14.9</a>)—among voters without a diploma or whose highest diploma was an elementary school leaving certificate and who comprised 72 percent of the electorate at the time. The left captured 49 percent of the vote among voters with a secondary-school diploma of one kind or another and who comprised 23 percent of the electorate in 1956. By contrast, the left parties claimed only 37 percent of the vote of those with a tertiary degree, who at the time made up only 5 percent of the electorate.</p>
<p>Could this be a statistical accident due to a small sample size or specific features of this particular election? The answer is no. Although the sample size is not as large as one might like, the vote differentials are highly statistically significant. Furthermore, we find exactly the same profile—the higher the level of education, the less likely the left-wing vote—in all elections in this period, in survey after survey, without exception, and regardless of the ambient political <span aria-label="745" id="pg_745" role="doc-pagebreak"/>climate. Specifically, the 1956 profile is repeated in 1958, 1962, 1965, and 1967.<sup><a href="#footnote-1427" id="footnote-1427-backlink" role="doc-noteref">35</a></sup> Not until the 1970s and 1980s does the shape of the profile begin to flatten and then gradually reverse. The new norm emerges with greater and greater clarity as we move into the 2000s and 2010s.</p>
<a id="fig14-9"/>

<figcaption><p class="FIGT"><small>FIG.</small> 14.9.  Left vote by level of education in France, 1956–2012</p>
<p class="CAP"><i>Interpretation:</i> In the 1956 legislative elections, 57 percent voters with a primary school education or less (72 percent of the electorate) voted for the left versus 50 percent for those with secondary diplomas (23 percent of the electorate) and 37 percent with tertiary diplomas (5 percent of the electorate). In the 2012 presidential elections, this educational cleavage had completely reversed: the left candidate obtained 58 percent of the vote of those with tertiary degrees in the second round versus 47 percent of those with at most a primary diploma (18 percent of the electorate). <i>Sources and series:</i> piketty.pse.ens.fr/ideology.</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>For example, in the presidential election of 2012, which Socialist Fran<span class="accent">ç</span>ois Hollande won over right-wing candidate Nicolas Sarkozy by 52 to 48 percent, we find that the left owed its victory entirely to better educated voters. Among individuals with no diploma or at most a primary diploma, who accounted for 18 percent of the electorate in 2012, the Socialist candidate obtained only 47 percent of the vote (<a href="chapter_14.xhtml#fig14-9">Fig. 14.9</a>). His score was 50 percent among voters with a secondary diploma (56 percent of the electorate) and 58 percent among those with a tertiary degree (26 percent of the electorate in 2012). Again, could this be a coincidence, perhaps related to the personality of the candidates? No. We <span aria-label="746" id="pg_746" role="doc-pagebreak"/>find exactly the same profile in all elections in this period: 2002, 2007, 2012, and 2017.<sup><a href="#footnote-1426" id="footnote-1426-backlink" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup></p>

</figure>
<p>More generally, when we look at the profiles of the left-wing vote in France by level of education over the entire period 1956–2017, it is striking to see how gradual and steady the change has been over these six decades. The profile is systematically decreasing from the beginning of the period to the middle, flattens out between 1970 and 2000, and then turns sharply upward toward the end of the period in the 2000s and 2010s (<a href="chapter_14.xhtml#fig14-10">Fig. 14.10</a>).</p>
<p>Several points call for clarification. First, all the results presented here on the vote breakdown pertain solely to voters. If one adds the fact that turnout of the less educated decreased toward the end of the period, the change is even more dramatic. In particular, it means that the support of the less educated for left-wing parties decreased even more sharply than is indicated in <a href="chapter_14.xhtml#fig14-10">Fig. 14.10</a>.</p>
<p>Second, it is important to add that the reversal of the overall educational cleavage occurred not just across the three educational levels considered—<span aria-label="747" id="pg_747" role="doc-pagebreak"/>primary, secondary, and tertiary—but also within each category. For example, among individuals with secondary diplomas, we find that, at the beginning of the period, those with the <i>baccaluréat</i> (that is, who completed the long secondary curriculum) were less likely to vote for the left than those with only a <i>brevet</i> (which is normally awarded at age 15 as opposed to 18 for the <i>bac</i>).<sup><a href="#footnote-1425" id="footnote-1425-backlink" role="doc-noteref">37</a></sup> At the end of the period, this has turned around: individuals with the <i>bac</i> were more likely to vote for the left than those whose secondary schooling ended earlier. The same is true among those with tertiary degrees, who can be broken down into smaller groups in surveys from the 1970s and beyond, as university education broadened and diversified. In particular, one can distinguish between those with short degrees, requiring only two or three years after the <i>bac,</i> and those with long degrees (<i>maîtrises, diplômes d’études avancées, grandes écoles</i> in business or science, etc.). In the elections of 1973, 1974, and 1978, when individuals with higher degrees generally tended to vote for parties of the right, this tendency was particularly pronounced among those with long degrees. This was also true in 1981 and 1988, but the gap was smaller. From the 1990s on, and even more clearly in the 2000s and 2010s, the cleavage reversed. The higher the tertiary degree, the more likely its holder was to vote for the left. This was true not only in 2012 when the Socialist candidate made his highest scores among those with long tertiary degrees but also in all other elections in this period.<sup><a href="#footnote-1424" id="footnote-1424-backlink" role="doc-noteref">38</a></sup></p>

<h1 class="head a-head"><a id="sec214"/><i>On the Robustness of the Reversal of the Educational Cleavage</i></h1>
<p class="noindent">Note, moreover, that this complete reversal of the educational cleavage also exists within each age cohort. More generally, it can be found in groups sharing similar sociodemographic and economic characteristics. Begin with the effect of age. One might think that the high percentage of individuals with tertiary <span aria-label="748" id="pg_748" role="doc-pagebreak"/>degrees voting for the Socialist candidate in 2012 was due not to the educational effect as such but rather to the fact that people with tertiary degrees are more likely to be younger and the young are more likely to vote for the left. This is true to some extent, and it helps to explain why the left-wing vote gap between those with and without tertiary degrees decreases slightly with age, but one can show that the age effect is relatively weak. Indeed, there are many young people without degrees and many older people with them, so the two effects can be clearly distinguished. In the end, the data show unambiguously, in survey after survey, that the educational effect within each age cohort is of roughly the same magnitude as in the population as a whole. Furthermore, the slight age bias has always been present: the young have always tended to vote more strongly for the left and are also more likely to have a higher educational level than the average for the whole population; this is true in the 1950s and 1960s as well as in the 2000s and 2010s. Technically, the curve obtained with age as a control variable is always slightly below the curve obtained without the control (because part of the educational effect is linked to age), but to a first approximation this effect has been constant over time, so that controlling for age has virtually no effect on the magnitude of the trend observed over the past half century, which in this sense seems to be quite robust (<a href="chapter_14.xhtml#fig14-11">Fig. 14.11</a>).<sup><a href="#footnote-1423" id="footnote-1423-backlink" role="doc-noteref">39</a></sup></p>
<p>Note, moreover, that the same general effect of age on voting is also found in other representative democracies; in no case does it alter the conclusion about the reversal of the educational cleavage. Specifically, we find that from the 1950s to the 2010s voters aged 18–34 were generally more likely than voters over age 65 to vote for left-wing parties in France, for the Democratic Party in the United States, and for the Labour Party in the United Kingdom. The reason for this is that the ideological positioning of these parties was generally more favorable to the aspirations of youth (in particular in regard to lifestyle and religion) whereas the parties of the right took positions more compatible with the views of older voters. Note, however, that the vote gap between younger and older voters was quite volatile in all three countries: it was particularly pronounced in the United States in the 1960s, in France in the 1970s, and in the United Kingdom in the late 2010s; by contrast, it was much weaker (or even negligible) in other periods, especially after a prolonged term in office for the parties of <span aria-label="749" id="pg_749" role="doc-pagebreak"/>the left.<sup><a href="#footnote-1422" id="footnote-1422-backlink" role="doc-noteref">40</a></sup> In any case, although this volatility of the youth vote is interesting, it has no effect on the basic tendency in which we are mainly interested here; namely, the complete reversal of the educational cleavage.</p>

<p class="CAP"><i>Interpretation:</i> In 1956 the parties of the left (Socialists, Communists, and Radicals) obtained a score seventeen points lower among voters with tertiary degrees than among those without; in 2012, the difference was eight points in the opposite direction.

<p><span aria-label="750" id="pg_750" role="doc-pagebreak"/>In <a href="chapter_14.xhtml#fig14-11">Fig. 14.11</a> I have also included sex and marital status among the control variables. This again has little impact on the educational effect: the reversal of the educational cleavage occurs among both men and women as well as both single and married individuals. It is worth noting that postelection surveys also confirm that women have been moving leftward over the long run. In the 1950s and 1960s, women were far more likely to vote for the right than men, especially in France and the United Kingdom and to a lesser extent in the United States. This bias decreased over the 1970s and 1980s and then reversed slightly in France and the United Kingdom (where women were a little more likely than men to vote for the left in the decades after 1990); in the United States the reversal was more pronounced.<sup><a href="#footnote-1421" id="footnote-1421-backlink" role="doc-noteref">41</a></sup> To account for this change, some researchers have emphasized the importance of rising divorce and separation rates and of the number of women—especially single mothers—living in economically precarious circumstances.<sup><a href="#footnote-1420" id="footnote-1420-backlink" role="doc-noteref">42</a></sup> More generally, this evolution reflects deep socioeconomic and political-ideological transformations regarding family structure, combined with the growing salience of the issue of gender equality. Workplace equality gradually emerged as the goal of many women, supplanting the patriarchal ideal of the housewife (which many women had internalized in the 1950s and 1960s); this feminist demand was championed primarily by parties of the left.<sup><a href="#footnote-1419" id="footnote-1419-backlink" role="doc-noteref">43</a></sup> As we saw in <a href="chapter_13.xhtml">Chapter 13</a>, however, gender-related income and wealth inequality remains quite high.</p>
<p>Finally, I also used income and wealth as control variables. As with age, controlling for income and wealth slightly alters the curve but not the underlying trend (<a href="chapter_14.xhtml#fig14-11">Fig. 14.11</a>). In other words, the reversal of the educational cleavage—that is, the fact that the more highly educated became more likely to vote for <span aria-label="751" id="pg_751" role="doc-pagebreak"/>the left in the period 1990–2020—is a phenomenon that exists at every level of income and wealth.<sup><a href="#footnote-1418" id="footnote-1418-backlink" role="doc-noteref">44</a></sup> I also included many other control variables, such as parents’ occupation, geographic location, and population of place of residence. None of these variables affected the reversal of the educational cleavage. We also find the same result when, instead of comparing individuals with and without tertiary degrees, we compare those with either tertiary or secondary degrees and those without, or the best educated 10 percent with the remaining 90 percent, or the best educated 50 percent with the other 50 percent.<sup><a href="#footnote-1417" id="footnote-1417-backlink" role="doc-noteref">45</a></sup> Given that the educational cleavage has changed direction and increased in magnitude at every level of education (or, to put it another way, given that the left-wing vote gap used to decrease with rising education but now increases), it makes little difference how one breaks down levels of education: the same reversal exists no matter how one does the calculation.</p>

<h1 class="head a-head"><a id="sec215"/><i>Reversal of the Educational Cleavage; Redefinition of Occupational Cleavages</i></h1>
<p class="noindent">If we now look at different occupations and sectors of activity, we find that the reversal of the educational cleavage is particularly striking for certain categories of work. Among the less educated individuals who voted strongly for parties of the left in the 1950s and 1960s but ceased to do so in the period 1990–2020, blue-collar workers stand out. The collapse of the working-class vote for socialist, communist, and social-democratic parties in Europe and for the Democrats in the United States and Labour in the United Kingdom is a well-known phenomenon that exists in all Western countries.<sup><a href="#footnote-1416" id="footnote-1416-backlink" role="doc-noteref">46</a></sup> The most obvious <span aria-label="752" id="pg_752" role="doc-pagebreak"/>explanation for this is that workers increasingly feel that the parties that were supposed to represent them have been less and less successful at doing so, especially in a context of falling industrial employment and globalization without sufficient collective regulation.</p>
<p>By contrast, certain highly educated groups continue to vote left (or have become more likely to vote left), including teachers, mid-level and supervisory personnel in the public sector, healthcare professionals, and individuals working in cultural professions. In other words, the reversal of the educational cleavage did not take place in a void or an unchanging environment. It occurred in rapidly changing societies, characterized by an unprecedented increase in the average level of training and access to secondary and higher education, coupled with an equally unprecedented expansion of service-sector employment.</p>
<p>It would nevertheless be a mistake to reduce the reversal of the educational cleavage to changes in the voting patterns of specific occupational groups (such as industrial workers and teachers). We find the same reversal in specific occupational groups and sectors of the economy. For example, among private-sector workers (or, more narrowly, nonindustrial private-sector workers or also among public-sector workers), we find that the less educated were more likely than the better educated to vote for parties of the left between 1950 and 1970, while the opposite is true between 1990 and 2020. It is not just industrial workers who have stopped voting for the left: disaffection is just as pronounced among less educated service workers. Unfortunately, the limitations of the data do not allow us to study the interaction between the occupational and educational effects with as much precision as we would like.<sup><a href="#footnote-1415" id="footnote-1415-backlink" role="doc-noteref">47</a></sup> But we have enough <span aria-label="753" id="pg_753" role="doc-pagebreak"/>information to conclude that the reversal of the educational cleavage is a general phenomenon not limited to a particular sector or political party.<sup><a href="#footnote-1414" id="footnote-1414-backlink" role="doc-noteref">48</a></sup></p>

<h1 class="head a-head"><a id="sec216"/><i>The Electoral Left and the Less Advantaged Classes: Anatomy of a Divorce</i></h1>
<p class="noindent">How can we explain why the electoral left, which in the 1950s and 1960s was the party of workers and other less advantaged groups, became the party of the highly educated in the 1990s and 2000s? We will not be able to answer this question fully until we have examined the trajectories of the United States, United Kingdom, and other countries, along with the many processes that may have contributed to this complex evolution. To simplify matters, it may be useful to divide the explanations into two broad categories: one based on a social hypothesis, the other on a nativist hypothesis (the two are not mutually exclusive). The social hypothesis, which I regard as by far the more important and convincing of the two, is that the less advantaged classes came to feel more and more abandoned by the parties of the left, which increasingly drew their support from other social categories (notably the better educated). By contrast, the nativist hypothesis holds rather that the parties of the left were abandoned by the less advantaged classes, which were fatally drawn to the sirens of racism and anti-immigration. The latter hypothesis is particularly widespread in the United States where it is often (correctly) pointed out that disadvantaged southern whites began a slow transition to the Republican Party after the Democrats took up the cause of racial equality and desegregation in the 1960s. Furthermore, a great deal of research on both Europe and the United States highlights the existence of growing cleavages around immigration and multiculturalism, which have allegedly driven a wedge between the less advantaged <span aria-label="754" id="pg_754" role="doc-pagebreak"/>classes and the electoral left.<sup><a href="#footnote-1413" id="footnote-1413-backlink" role="doc-noteref">49</a></sup> This hypothesis deserves to be taken seriously, and I will examine it closely in what follows. There is no denying that in recent decades, nativist, racist, and anti-immigrant themes have been exploited to the hilt by parties of the traditional right (starting with the Republican Party in the United States and the Conservative Party in the United Kingdom) as well as by new movements of the far right that have mobilized around these issues (for which the archetype is the Front National in France).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the nativist hypothesis poses numerous problems and, in my view, fails to give a correct account of the observed changes. The key fact is that the reversal of the educational cleavage is a long-term phenomenon that began in the 1960s and 1970s, not only in the United States but also in France and the United Kingdom, which was well before the immigration cleavage became truly salient in Europe. It is obviously very convenient for the elites to explain everything by stigmatizing the supposed racism of the less advantaged. However racism is not more “natural” among the least favored classes than among the well-offs. If the less advantaged truly supported anti-immigrant movements, their turnout should be at a peak today. The fact that it is very low clearly shows that many less advantaged voters are not satisfied with the choices presented to them. Finally, when we come to examine the whole range of countries for which we possess comparable data, we will find that the educational cleavage has also reversed in places where the immigration cleavage plays virtually no role. All this argues in favor of the social hypothesis—that is, the idea that the less advantaged classes feel abandoned by the parties of the center-left. Indeed, nativist discourse has fastened on this sense of abandonment in the hope of winning over these disillusioned voters.</p>

<h1 class="head a-head"><a id="sec217"/><i>The “Brahmin Left” and the Question of Social and Educational Justice</i></h1>
<p class="noindent">Let us try now to better understand the significance of the social hypothesis in the French case. Look again at the evolution observed from the legislative elections of 1956 to the presidential elections of 2012 (<a href="chapter_14.xhtml#fig14-9">Fig. 14.9</a>). In 1956, <span aria-label="755" id="pg_755" role="doc-pagebreak"/>72 percent of voters had no diploma beyond primary school. In 2012, only 18 percent of voters fit this description. In other words, the vast majority of the children and grandchildren of the less educated voters of 1956 were able to remain in school longer, some to earn secondary diplomas and others tertiary degrees of one kind or another. What is striking is that among those children and grandchildren, those who managed to make it to university (and particularly those who earned the more advanced university degrees) are the ones who continued to vote for the parties of the left with the same frequency as the less educated voters of 1956. Those who settled for secondary diplomas (especially those who obtained only a <i>brevet</i> and did not go all the way to the <i>baccalauréat</i>) were clearly less enthusiastic about voting for those same parties. Those who “remained” at the primary level or quit before finishing primary school massively deserted the parties of the left.</p>
<p>A natural explanation for this disaffection with the electoral left is the perception that the parties of the left totally changed in nature and adopted completely new platforms. Briefly put, the social hypothesis is this: that the less educationally advantaged classes came to believe that the parties of the left now favor the newly advantaged educated classes and their children over people of more modest backgrounds. There is much evidence in favor of this hypothesis, which suggests that it is not a mere impression but has a solid basis in fact. It bears emphasizing that this major political-ideological and programmatic shift was steady, gradual, and largely unforeseen; it also coincided with a significant expansion of educational opportunity. In other words, the electoral left was transformed from the workers’ party into the party of the educated (which I propose to call the “Brahmin left”). This transformation was unwitting; it was not the result of any single person’s decision.<sup><a href="#footnote-1412" id="footnote-1412-backlink" role="doc-noteref">50</a></sup> Indeed, it is easy to understand why those who improved their social status through education and particularly through public schooling would in many ways feel grateful to the parties of the left, which always stressed the importance of education as a means to emancipation and social advancement.<sup><a href="#footnote-1411" id="footnote-1411-backlink" role="doc-noteref">51</a></sup> The problem is that many who succeeded in this way developed smug and condescending attitudes toward the rest of the <span aria-label="756" id="pg_756" role="doc-pagebreak"/>population; or, to put it more charitably, they did not inquire too deeply into whether official “meritocratic” pronouncements corresponded to reality or not. Thus, the former workers’ party became the party of the winners of the educational system and gradually moved away from the disadvantaged classes, much as Young had imagined when he foresaw the widening gulf between “technicians” and “populists” in his premonitory fictional account of 1958.<sup><a href="#footnote-1410" id="footnote-1410-backlink" role="doc-noteref">52</a></sup></p>
<p>Conflict between the new disadvantaged classes, which gradually deserted the parties of the left, and the new educated classes of the “Brahmin left” has taken a variety of forms in recent decades (and continues to this day). The two groups differ regarding how public services are organized; how cities, suburbs, and rural areas are financed; what cultural activities are supported; and how the transportation infrastructure is designed and maintained. We also see conflict between large cities, especially Paris and its environs, where many of the highly educated now live, and smaller cities and rural areas that are less well integrated into the global economy.<sup><a href="#footnote-1409" id="footnote-1409-backlink" role="doc-noteref">53</a></sup> The issue of financing high-speed rail service (TGV), which is so expensive that it is used mainly by the favored classes of the big cities, and the concomitant closing of local lines linking smaller cities and towns, is another clear example of this kind of cleavage. Issues of taxation and apportionment of the fiscal burden have also become quite salient, especially since the 1980s and 1990s, when the left in power played an important role in liberalizing capital flows without insisting on concomitant exchanges of information or social and fiscal coordination. This benefited the wealthy and mobile while increasing the tax burden on classes perceived to be immobile (which were hit with higher indirect and payroll taxes).<sup><a href="#footnote-1408" id="footnote-1408-backlink" role="doc-noteref">54</a></sup></p>
<p>Finally, conflict between the less advantaged categories and the “Brahmin left” is also rooted in the organization of the educational system itself. Bear in mind that French schools and universities are extremely stratified and inegalitarian. Primary and secondary curricula have gradually been unified in the sense that, in theory, all children have had access since the 1970s to the same oppor<span aria-label="757" id="pg_757" role="doc-pagebreak"/>tunities, with identical programs and financing for all primary schools and <i>collèges</i> (junior high schools), at least up to the age of 15.<sup><a href="#footnote-1407" id="footnote-1407-backlink" role="doc-noteref">55</a></sup> By contrast, three separate types of <i>lycées</i> (high schools) remain: general, technological, and professional. In practice, these strongly reproduce existing social cleavages. Even more serious is the extremely hierarchical nature of the French system of higher education. On the one hand there are the so-called <i>grandes écoles,</i> which prepare students for careers in science, business, and public service. To gain access to these schools, students normally attend special preparatory classes. These schools are highly selective and elitist; graduates often go on to fill executive positions in both the public and private sector as well as top jobs in management, engineering, and the civil service.<sup><a href="#footnote-1406" id="footnote-1406-backlink" role="doc-noteref">56</a></sup> On the other hand, there are universities, which historically have not been allowed to select their students: in principle, any student with a <i>baccalauréat</i> is automatically admitted. And there are also so-called technological universities (IUTs), which offer shorter curricula of two to three years.</p>
<p>In practice, the children of the advantaged classes are overrepresented in the preparatory classes and the <i>grandes écoles,</i> which benefit from public financing two to three times as high per student as in the universities, where most children of the less advantaged classes end up. To justify this system, a slogan was invented: “republican elitism.” This is supposed to be a good thing. The existence of elitism is acknowledged, but it is justified as “republican” because it is supposed to serve the general interest and is based on merit and <span aria-label="758" id="pg_758" role="doc-pagebreak"/>equality of opportunity. Hence it presumably has nothing in common with the hereditary privileges enjoyed by the elites of the Ancien R<span class="accent">é</span>gime. Like any ideological system, this one has a certain prima facie plausibility. All societies need to select the individuals who will occupy posts of responsibility, and to do so by means of competitive examinations and the investment of significant public resources might seem to be fairer than selection on the basis of high tuition fees and parental gifts.<sup><a href="#footnote-1405" id="footnote-1405-backlink" role="doc-noteref">57</a></sup> Nevertheless, the French educational system can be seen as particularly inegalitarian and hypocritical. Because there is boundless faith in exams as the basis of a just inequality, the fate of an individual can be decided by performance in school at the age of 18 or 20. It is also difficult to justify the fact that far greater public funds go to socially advantaged students than to students from less privileged backgrounds. Ultimately, the result of such policies is to exacerbate rather than diminish existing differences between families.</p>
<p>In fact, the electoral left, having become the party of the educated, has also become the advocate and champion of republican elitism, even more so than the “bourgeois” parties that the left opposed when it was the party of workers. Led by the Socialist Party, the electoral left has held power repeatedly since the early 1980s (a little more than half the time all told). Each time it commanded parliamentary majorities that should have enabled it to transform French higher education.<sup><a href="#footnote-1404" id="footnote-1404-backlink" role="doc-noteref">58</a></sup> For example, it could have decided to make structural changes by investing as much per student in the universities as in the <i>grandes écoles.</i> Why did the Socialists not do this? Probably because they felt that the elitist structure of higher education financing was justified or else because they preferred to spend the money on other priorities (including lower taxes for the advantaged classes).<sup><a href="#footnote-1403" id="footnote-1403-backlink" role="doc-noteref">59</a></sup></p>
<p>All told, looking at the allocation of resources throughout the educational system (primary, secondary, and tertiary), we find that the current system invests nearly three times as much public money in each child belonging to the top decile in terms of educational expenditure as in each child in the bottom 50 percent.<sup><a href="#footnote-1402" id="footnote-1402-backlink" role="doc-noteref">60</a></sup> These significant educational inequalities, which largely overlap social inequalities, are due both to differences in access to secondary and higher <span aria-label="759" id="pg_759" role="doc-pagebreak"/>education and to inequalities of spending within the system. Note, moreover, that due to lack of adequate data, these estimates understate the degree of these inequalities. In particular they are based on the hypothesis that all children benefit from the same average expenditure for each year spent in primary or secondary schooling. The evidence suggests, however, that spending on children of the least advantaged groups is also lower at these levels.</p>
<p>To be more specific, a number of researchers have shown that socially disadvantaged schools, <i>collèges,</i> and <i>lycées</i> were assigned less experienced teachers. They also had more temporary teachers and unreplaced absences, despite the fact that the effects of these shortcoming on students have been convincingly shown to be both negative and significantly higher for less advantaged students.<sup><a href="#footnote-1401" id="footnote-1401-backlink" role="doc-noteref">61</a></sup> For example, if we look at public <i>collèges</i> in the Paris region, we find that the percentage of (untenured) contract and novice teachers was barely 10 percent in Paris and in the most advantaged <i>départements</i> such as Hauts-de-Seine, but it was as high as 50 percent in disadvantaged <i>départements</i> such as Val-de-Marne and Seine-Saint Denis.<sup><a href="#footnote-1400" id="footnote-1400-backlink" role="doc-noteref">62</a></sup> Of course, the same is true in most Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries (which is scarcely reassuring): students from privileged backgrounds are more likely to be taught by experienced, tenured teachers than those from disadvantaged backgrounds, who are often taught by substitute or contract teachers. Research has shown, however, that the gaps are particularly high in France.<sup><a href="#footnote-1399" id="footnote-1399-backlink" role="doc-noteref">63</a></sup></p>

<section epub:type="division">
<h1 class="head a-head"><a id="sec218"/><i>On the Need for New Norms of Educational Justice</i></h1>
<p class="noindent">Hypocrisy in this realm is particularly extreme, since on the one hand French governments have established priority education zones (which have existed in France since the 1980s), in which certain schools are designated as particularly <span aria-label="760" id="pg_760" role="doc-pagebreak"/>disadvantaged and in need of extra support, while on the other hand more resources are in fact allocated to schools in more advantaged areas. To be sure, bonus systems for teachers have been set up in some priority education zones. But all signs are that these (rather opaque) mechanisms are not sufficient to compensate for more than a small part of the enormous gaps due to the fact that the poorer schools have a much higher proportion of inexperienced and contract teachers. If we were to look at the total resources devoted to each student as a function of the social position of the parents, it is highly likely that we would find that the most substantial amounts went to the most privileged students and schools and particularly to the most prestigious big-city <i>lycées,</i> whose faculties contain the highest proportions of experienced teachers with advanced degrees.</p>
<p>Recent research has lifted part of the veil. If one calculates the average salary of a teacher at any level (primary school, <i>collège,</i> or <i>lycée</i>), considering not only bonuses paid in priority education zones but also all other supplemental pay (for seniority, level of education, tenured or contract status, etc.), one finds that the higher the percentage of students from privileged social classes, the higher the average teacher pay. The relationship is strictly increasing in both <i>collèges</i> and <i>lycées.</i> The average number of students per class is also higher in the more privileged schools, and the two effects balance out so that the average expenditure per pupil is almost constant. Nevertheless, the more privileged <i>collège</i> and <i>lycée</i> students arguably receive a better treatment: there are more of them per class, but the average level of the students is higher, and they have more experienced, better trained, and better paid teachers.<sup><a href="#footnote-1398" id="footnote-1398-backlink" role="doc-noteref">64</a></sup> In any case, the very fact that such information is not published regularly so that it can serve as the basis of an evolving and verifiable educational reform policy raises serious questions. <span aria-label="761" id="pg_761" role="doc-pagebreak"/>This is all the more unfortunate because a transparent, avowed effort to channel additional resources to the least advantaged schools (especially at the primary level) could substantially reduce social inequality with respect to scholastic success.<sup><a href="#footnote-1397" id="footnote-1397-backlink" role="doc-noteref">65</a></sup></p>
<p>Quite apart from the issue of inequality of resources, it is also important to note that social segregation in the French educational system has increased dramatically. Of the 85,000 pupils registered in the 175 Parisian <i>collèges</i> (junior high schools), 16 percent come from the least advantaged classes. But if one looks at the geographic distribution, it turns out that some <i>collèges</i> have fewer than 1 percent of disadvantaged students while others have more than 60 percent. Among the <i>collèges</i> almost entirely closed to the less advantaged classes, the vast majority are private and nearly a third of Paris <i>collégiens</i> attend them, and yet—this is one of the astonishing peculiarities of the French system—they are almost entirely financed by public funds, even though they retain the right to select their students as they wish with no obligation to conform to any common rules.<sup><a href="#footnote-1396" id="footnote-1396-backlink" role="doc-noteref">66</a></sup> We also find many public <i>collèges</i> with only a few percent of less advantaged students, while in other public <i>collèges</i> only a few M<span class="accent">é</span>tro stops away nearly half the students are disadvantaged.<sup><a href="#footnote-1395" id="footnote-1395-backlink" role="doc-noteref">67</a></sup> The reasons for <span aria-label="762" id="pg_762" role="doc-pagebreak"/>this include significant residential segregation, recourse to private schools to escape the confines of public districting, and most important of all, the absence of any public policy that seeks to change the situation. Yet recent experiments have shown that better designed and more transparent assignment algorithms could achieve more thorough social mixing.<sup><a href="#footnote-1394" id="footnote-1394-backlink" role="doc-noteref">68</a></sup></p>
<p>I do not claim that these factors by themselves are sufficient to account for the reversal of the educational cleavage over the past few decades or for the fact that the least advantaged classes feel less and less well represented by the parties of the left. Clearly, however, such glaring educational inequalities may have made people wary of the Socialists in power and lent credence to the belief that they cared more about the better educated and their children than about children from more modest backgrounds.</p>
<p>Since the financial crisis of 2008, educational budgets have stagnated, adding to the frustration, particularly among disadvantaged youth who had been led to believe that working to obtain a <i>baccalauréat</i> would open the doors to higher education and employment. In fact, whereas barely 30 percent of each age cohort obtained the <i>bac</i> in the 1980s, that figure rose to 60 percent by 2000 and to nearly 80 percent in 2018, partly thanks to a very sharp increase in the number of technological <i>bacs.</i> The number of university students increased by 20 percent from 2008 to 2018, rising from barely 2.2 million to nearly 2.7 million. Unfortunately, resources did not increase commensurately: in real terms, budgets increased only 10 percent, which means that the budget per student decreased by 10 percent.<sup><a href="#footnote-1393" id="footnote-1393-backlink" role="doc-noteref">69</a></sup> Note that the resources per student in the elitist and selective schools where most students came from advantaged groups were maintained. By contrast, students in the regular universities had to study in conditions that fell far short of the promises that had been made to them. For instance, despite the rapid growth of the number of students with technological or professional <i>bacs,</i> the number of places in the so-called university institutes of technology (IUT) increased very little, for want of resources. This created tensions, which were exacerbated by the fact that students with the general <i>bac</i> also sought to fill these places; many of them came from advantaged backgrounds but failed to get into a preparatory class for the <i>grandes écoles</i> and chose to go to an IUT rather than to a general university <span aria-label="763" id="pg_763" role="doc-pagebreak"/>(where guidance is hard to come by and job opportunities after graduation are sometimes wanting).</p>
<p>This explosive situation became the subject of a recent TV series, <i>Le Baron noir</i> (2016), which features a rather unsavory Socialist president aided by a slightly corrupt deputy from the Nord, Philippe Rickwaert, who tries to buff up the government’s image with a symbolic measure of educational justice. To that end, he supports the demands of a group of students from the downscale Paris suburbs. These students, who have graduated with the less prestigious <i>bac professionnel,</i> want a number of places set aside for them in the so-called technological universities (IUTs), from which they feel they have been unfairly displaced by students with the more prestigious <i>bac général.</i> Rickwaert goes so far as to don a worker’s coveralls when he defends the measure in the National Assembly, explaining that by championing the disadvantaged classes he is putting “the social” back in socialist and doing honor to the left. But these tactics displease the party’s <i>jeunesse dorée,</i> the militants of the Young Socialist Movement, who, as is only to be expected, have graduated from the capital’s fanciest <i>lycées généraux.</i> To torpedo the movement of their suburban rivals, they go so far as to infiltrate one of their meetings. Shortly thereafter, the leader of the suburban students is compromised by a photograph proving that he is close to accepting a position on a list of right-wing candidates in an upcoming European parliamentary election. This is taken as proof that only young socialists from the classier <i>lycées</i> are fit to defend the values of the Brahmin left, which the upstarts from the downscale suburbs are prepared to comprise by complicity with the merchant right.</p>
<p>This series also deserves credit for highlighting another factor that will surely play a growing role in future debates about educational justice: the algorithms used to assign students to different educational tracks. Not so long ago (and to this day in some countries), it was common for parents to use personal connections to get their children into preferred high schools and universities. It is hard to deny that compared to this, impersonal algorithms represent progress toward greater social justice and democracy—but only if they are designed in a transparent manner with abundant input from citizens, which is far from the case today. In 2018, the Post-Bac Admissions (APB) algorithm was replaced by a new algorithm called Parcoursup, which established social quotas for admission to the preparatory classes leading to the <i>grandes écoles;</i> this has the potential to result in a more socially just selection process. But the parameters on which the Parcoursup quotas are based remain completely obscure, and only scholarship students are eligible, which disadvantages students <span aria-label="764" id="pg_764" role="doc-pagebreak"/>whose parents’ earnings are just slightly above the scholarship cutoff (this is also the case with the Affelnet system by which students are assigned to <i>lycées</i>). If one hopes to achieve norms of justice acceptable to the majority, it would no doubt be better to design a system that factors in social origin in a more gradual and continuous manner and, above all, does so more transparently. It is interesting to note that India, which makes broad use of quotas and “reservations,” is in some ways more advanced in dealing with these issues than are the Western countries.<sup><a href="#footnote-1392" id="footnote-1392-backlink" role="doc-noteref">70</a></sup> Properly used, such democratic tools can break the deadlock in which debate about education has been stuck for decades. I will come back to this.</p>

<h1 class="head a-head"><a id="sec219"/><i>On Property, from Left and Right</i></h1>
<p class="noindent">We turn now to the evolution of electoral cleavages involving inequalities of income and wealth. Let us begin by examining the vote profile of the electoral left as a function of income from the 1950s to the 2010s (<a href="chapter_14.xhtml#fig14-12">Fig. 14.12</a>). It is striking to observe that this profile has consistently been relatively flat across the lower 90 percent of the income distribution (with little variation in the average support for parties of the left), but with support for the left falling off sharply among the highest paid 10 percent, particularly from the 1950s through the 1970s. For example, in the 1978 legislative elections, the electoral left won more than 50 percent of the vote in most income deciles, but this figure drops sharply in the top decile and dips to less than 20 percent among the top centile.<sup><a href="#footnote-1391" id="footnote-1391-backlink" role="doc-noteref">71</a></sup> From the 1990s on, the slope steadily decreases. In the 2012 presidential election, the Socialist candidate won almost 50 percent of the vote in the top income decile and nearly 40 percent in the top centile.</p>
<p>This flattening of the curve is a logical consequence of the fact that the highly educated now vote more heavily for the left. Note, however, that until the 2010s high earners continued to prefer parties of the right, in contrast to the highly educated. In the 1990s, in other words, the partisan cleavage structure shifted to a system of two elites: the highly educated voted left, while high <span aria-label="765" id="pg_765" role="doc-pagebreak"/>earners voted right (<a href="chapter_14.xhtml#fig14-1">Fig. 14.1</a>).<sup><a href="#footnote-1390" id="footnote-1390-backlink" role="doc-noteref">72</a></sup> The key question is how long this will last. It may be that in the future the highly educated will tend to earn the highest incomes and possess the largest fortunes and perhaps draw to their coalitions high-income and high-wealth individuals who do not hold advanced degrees so that both elites will end up in the same party. This possibility cannot be ruled out, and we will see that it is close to becoming a reality in France and the United States. But things are actually more complex. There are two main reasons why the highly educated and the highly paid do not necessarily vote for the same parties. This was the case in both the presidential and legislative elections of 2012, and it may continue to be the case in the future (which does not mean that the two elites cannot agree on many issues, such as setting a low priority on reducing inequality).</p>

<p class="CAP"><i>Interpretation:</i> In 1978, the parties of the left (Socialist, Communist, Radical, Green) obtained 46 percent of the vote among the bottom income decile, 38 percent in the middle decile, and 17 percent among the top 1 percent. More broadly, the profile of the left-wing vote is fairly flat across the bottom 90 percent of the income distribution and sharply decreasing in the top 10 percent, especially early in the period. <i>Note:</i> D1 refers to the bottom 10 percent of the distribution, D2 to the next 10 percent, and D10 to the top 10 percent. <i>Sources and series:</i> piketty.pse.ens.fr/ideology.</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p><span aria-label="766" id="pg_766" role="doc-pagebreak"/>First, for a given level of education, those who are more successful at monetizing their education in the form of higher pay are clearly more likely to vote for the right. The data do not allow us to determine why they earn more: it may be because they chose more remunerative careers (in the private rather than the public sector, say, or a higher-paying job within a given sector) or because they were more successful in winning promotions and getting ahead. But in any case, they are more likely to vote for the right, perhaps because they see it as in their own best interest in that right-wing parties generally favor lower taxes on high incomes or because they hold a worldview according to which income is the reward for individual effort. In other words, the Brahmin left and the merchant right do not share precisely the same experiences and aspirations. The Brahmin left values scholastic success, intellectual work, and the acquisition of diplomas and knowledge; the merchant right emphasizes professional motivation, a flair for business, and negotiating skills. Each group invokes an ideology of merit and just inequality, but the type of effort expected is not exactly the same—nor is the reward for that effort.<sup><a href="#footnote-1389" id="footnote-1389-backlink" role="doc-noteref">73</a></sup></p>
<p>Second, at any given level of education, some individuals may have higher incomes than others because they own capital that produces income (rent, interest, dividends, etc.) and allows them to engage in professions that require substantial investment or perhaps even run a company (possibly a family firm). In fact, it is generally the case in all periods and all countries for which adequate data are available that wealth is a much stronger determinant of electoral preference than either income or education. In particular, the curve showing the vote for parties of the left as a function of wealth is much more steeply sloped than the corresponding curve for income (<a href="chapter_14.xhtml#fig14-13">Fig. 14.13</a>). For example, in the 1978 legislative elections, the left’s share of the vote fell to just over 10 percent in the top wealth centile (nearly 90 percent of whom therefore voted for the right), compared with 70 percent in the bottom income decile. In other words, property ownership appears to be an almost irresistible determinant of political attitude: the wealthiest asset holders virtually never vote for the left, while those <span aria-label="767" id="pg_767" role="doc-pagebreak"/>who not own anything seldom vote for the right. The relation between voting and wealth grew weaker after 1970 but still remains much stronger than the relation between voting and income.<sup><a href="#footnote-1388" id="footnote-1388-backlink" role="doc-noteref">74</a></sup></p>

</figure>
<p><span aria-label="768" id="pg_768" role="doc-pagebreak"/>The decisive role of wealth in determining political attitudes will come as no surprise. In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the property regime was the central issue of political-ideological conflict. Only since the end of the twentieth century has the issue of education and the type of educational regime assumed comparable importance. Historically, the political regime that emerged from the French Revolution was built around the defense of private property (with limited redistribution), as noted earlier.<sup><a href="#footnote-1387" id="footnote-1387-backlink" role="doc-noteref">75</a></sup> In his <i>Tableau politique de la France de l’ouest sous la Troisième République,</i> published in 1913, Andr<span class="accent">é</span> Siegfried carefully and systematically studied legislative votes from 1871 to 1910, canton by canton, relating the vote to taxes paid in proportion to agricultural acreage and to the results of a vast ministerial survey of public and private schooling of girls. His conclusions are perfectly clear. In cantons where land redistribution during the French Revolution enabled peasants to acquire small plots, they voted for republican parties, which at the time stood on the left of the political spectrum (notably the Radical Party, so called because it was the most radically republican).</p>
<p>By contrast, in cantons where the land remained concentrated in the hands of large property owners, often of noble origin, and where the Catholic Church remained influential, particularly through its control of schools, voters favored conservative and monarchist candidates. In the most conservative cantons, such as L<span class="accent">é</span>on in northwest Brittany, there were even astonishing legislative battles between priests and aristocrats, including one contest that pitted Abb<span class="accent">é</span> Gayrault against the Comte de Blois in 1897. So deep was the attachment of the people to local religious elites that the representatives of the old clerical class often emerged victorious from these contests. Siegfried described a world in which the old trifunctional order still held sway, reassuring citizens who continued to turn to the ch<span class="accent">â</span>teau and the presbytery for leadership. They were wary of what Parisian republicans had in mind for them because they had no concrete, practical knowledge of what republican government might mean.<sup><a href="#footnote-1386" id="footnote-1386-backlink" role="doc-noteref">76</a></sup></p>

<h1 class="head a-head"><a id="sec220"/><span aria-label="769" id="pg_769" role="doc-pagebreak"/><i>The Left and the Self-Employed: A Twentieth-Century Chronicle of Suspicion</i></h1>
<p class="noindent">The world that Siegfried describes was on the point of disappearing as he wrote, however. As a good republican of the center-left, he worried about the modest breakthroughs of the “collectivists” in western France, especially among workers in the arsenals of Brest and sardine fishermen in Concarneau. Elsewhere in France, however, Socialist candidates were making more significant progress. Between the two world wars, the Socialist and Communist Parties, which had split at the Congress of Tours in 1920, gradually gained the ascendancy over the Radicals, whom they drove toward the center. After World War II the Radicals were eliminated almost entirely. When it came to private property, Socialist and Communist ideology was quite a bit more subversive than that of the Radicals or republicans of the center-left. Whereas the Radicals had been champions of smallholders, peasants, merchants, and the self-employed of all kinds, and of “social reform respectful of private property,” notably by way of the income tax sponsored by Joseph Caillaux, the Socialists and Communists advocated collectivization of the means of production, especially in the industrial sector. Until the 1980s their platforms always included calls for the nationalization of key industries. Throughout the twentieth century they did try to persuade self-employed small businessmen that they had no intention of doing them harm and that people of modest wealth had nothing to fear. But in the absence of definite and reassuring propositions, suspicion of Socialists and Communists remained strong among the self-employed and indeed would continue so until very recently.</p>
<p>This wariness among peasants, small businessmen, craftspeople, and other independents largely accounts for the relatively flat profile of the left-wing vote as a function of income up to the ninetieth percentile (<a href="chapter_14.xhtml#fig14-12">Fig. 14.12</a>). From the 1950s until the 1970s and beyond, the lower income deciles consisted in large part of independent workers, whose income was certainly low but who nevertheless owned a small amount of property (a field, a farm, or a store) and were extremely suspicious of the plans of the collectivists. The weight of independents, and especially peasants, explains the particularly flat profile of the left-wing vote in France in the period 1950–1980; in the United Kingdom and <span aria-label="770" id="pg_770" role="doc-pagebreak"/>United States this same profile slopes much more markedly downward in the lower nine deciles than it does in France.<sup><a href="#footnote-1385" id="footnote-1385-backlink" role="doc-noteref">77</a></sup></p>
<p>In retrospect, such outlandish fear of the parties of the left may bring a smile to the lips. French Socialists and Communists never had either the power or the intention to turn farms and shops into Soviet-style <i>kolkhozes, sovkhozes,</i> and <i>gastronoms</i> (as the quite un-gastronomic chain of state-run supermarkets was called in the Soviet era). But they also never had the opportunity to explain clearly what their long-term intentions were with respect to small and medium private property or how they conceived its role in the ideal society they envisioned. This ambiguity and uncertainty on the question of property are by no means minor matters. They are at the root of major rifts between Socialists and Communists and between both parties and the rest of society (starting with the self-employed). They go a long way toward explaining why the Social Democrats and Communists in Germany were never able to join forces against the Nazis in the 1930s, and why Radicals, Socialists, and Communists were unable to form durable coalitions in the interwar years (apart from the important but ephemeral Popular Front of 1936–1938). This serious conflict around the property regime and support for the Soviet model (as well as colonialism) also largely explains why the Socialists often governed in so-called third-force coalitions with the Radicals and the center-right between 1947 and 1958. Since these coalitions excluded both the Communists and the Gaullists, this choice was tantamount to governing from the center.<sup><a href="#footnote-1384" id="footnote-1384-backlink" role="doc-noteref">78</a></sup></p>
<p>Beyond the existential fear of expropriation of small property owners, it is important to note that the parties of the left themselves contributed to the climate of suspicion and conflict, especially in debates over taxes—particularly the income tax—where they took positions much more favorable to wage workers than to the self-employed. Recall that the income tax adopted in 1914–1917 included both a general tax on income (based on total income from all sources) and a so-called cedular tax that was levied separately on different <span aria-label="771" id="pg_771" role="doc-pagebreak"/>types of income (wages, self-employment income, profits, interest, etc.).<sup><a href="#footnote-1383" id="footnote-1383-backlink" role="doc-noteref">79</a></sup> The cedular tax on wages was much lower than on self-employment income. Wage earners enjoyed significant deductions, so that only 10–15 percent of the highest paid actually paid this tax, while the self-employed paid tax on their full income, which they were required to declare in detail. Angered by such flagrant injustice, peasants, merchants, craftsmen, and other modest self-employed individuals energetically mobilized and won various concessions and compensations in the 1920s and 1930s. But wage earners, defended by the Socialists and Communists, rejected the idea of applying identical rules to both groups because this would have implied higher taxes on workers with low to modest wages, which they regarded as unacceptable, and therefore preferred sticking with a blatantly unfair arrangement.<sup><a href="#footnote-1382" id="footnote-1382-backlink" role="doc-noteref">80</a></sup></p>
<p>This situation continued after World War II. The tax reforms of 1948 and 1959 were supposed to unify the system with common rules applied to income of all types, but there were actually special deductions for wage earners, who were also exempt from paying the <i>taxe proportionnelle.</i><sup><a href="#footnote-1381" id="footnote-1381-backlink" role="doc-noteref">81</a></sup> This issue was also largely responsible for a violent antitax and pro-small-business protest movement, which resulted in a Poujadist surge in the 1956 legislative elections.<sup><a href="#footnote-1380" id="footnote-1380-backlink" role="doc-noteref">82</a></sup> In <span aria-label="772" id="pg_772" role="doc-pagebreak"/>the eyes of the Socialists and Communists, the favorable treatment of salaried workers was justified by the fact that the self-employed were all too inclined to understate their income, which wage earners could not do. The argument is understandable, but it was also clearly destined to fail. Instituting a special exemption to compensate wage earners for the fraud allegedly committed by the self-employed would obviously do nothing to decrease fraud nor would it help to develop norms of fiscal justice acceptable to all. Though technical in appearance, these debates played a central role in structuring the electoral cleavage between salaried workers and the self-employed in the twentieth century.<sup><a href="#footnote-1379" id="footnote-1379-backlink" role="doc-noteref">83</a></sup> Fiscal antagonism between rural and urban areas also played an important role in defining political identities in the nineteenth century.<sup><a href="#footnote-1378" id="footnote-1378-backlink" role="doc-noteref">84</a></sup> What these conflicts show is that the question of social and fiscal justice cannot be dealt with in the abstract, independent of its institutional and administrative setting. A just tax must be constructed historically and politically on the basis of information about the ability of different taxpayers to share the overall burden. For this, one needs to be able to record and evaluate the wealth and income of people whose situations and economic activities may vary widely.</p>

<h1 class="head a-head"><a id="sec221"/><i>Strengths and Weaknesses of the “Brahmin Left” and “Merchant Right”</i></h1>
<p class="noindent">With the end of Soviet communism and bipolar confrontations over private property, the expansion of educational opportunity, and the rise of the “Brahmin left,” the political-ideological landscape was totally transformed. <span aria-label="773" id="pg_773" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Within a few years the platforms of left-wing parties that had advocated nationalization (especially in the United Kingdom and France), much to the dismay of the self-employed, had disappeared without being replaced by any clear alternative. A dual-elite system emerged, with on one side, a “Brahmin left,” which attracted the votes of the highly educated, and on the other side, a “merchant right,” which continued to win more support from both highly paid and wealthier votes (<a href="chapter_14.xhtml#fig14-1">Fig. 14.1</a>). We will find this same cleavage structure in the United States, the United Kingdom, and other Western countries. This balance, though robust in some respects, is fragile in others and therefore extremely unstable.</p>
<p>The strength of the Brahmin-merchant duo is that the two sides embody complementary values and experiences. They share certain characteristics, including a certain conservatism when it comes to maintaining the existing inequality regime. The Brahmin left believes in rewarding scholastic effort and talent; the merchant right, on the other hand, emphasizes business talent. The Brahmin left seeks to accumulate diplomas, knowledge, and human capital; the merchant right accumulates cash and financial assets. On some points there are differences. The Brahmin left may prefer somewhat higher taxes than the merchant right: for instance, to pay for the <i>lycées, grandes écoles,</i> and cultural and artistic institutions to which it is attached.<sup><a href="#footnote-1377" id="footnote-1377-backlink" role="doc-noteref">85</a></sup> But both camps are strongly attached to the existing economic system and to globalization as it is currently organized, which ultimately serves the interests of both intellectual elites and economic and financial elites.</p>
<p>At bottom, the Brahmin left and merchant right embody two different forms of legitimacy. Indeed, this system of dual elites in a sense represents a return to the deep logic of premodern trifunctional society based on power sharing between intellectual and warrior elites, except that the warriors have been replaced by merchants (because security of goods and persons is now assured by the centralized state). The Brahmin left and merchant right can either alternate in power or govern together in a coalition of elites. An interesting example of coalition-formation was the 2017 election in France, in which center-<span aria-label="774" id="pg_774" role="doc-pagebreak"/>left joined with center-right; I will say more about this in a moment. As the highly educated become wealthier, it is even possible that there will be a socioeconomic fusion of the two elites to the point where a single party representing both will be the logical outcome. In late-nineteenth-century India, the Brahmins were both the best educated and the largest property owners.<sup><a href="#footnote-1376" id="footnote-1376-backlink" role="doc-noteref">86</a></sup> Since individuals from different elites tend to make different career choices (with one group choosing, say, work in the public sector or cultural professions and the other private-sector marketing and finance), it may be that the two elites will never fuse completely, however.</p>
<p>While this political equilibrium is clearly quite potent, it is also extremely precarious. As noted earlier, one symptom of this weakness is the withdrawal of the less advantaged classes (<a href="chapter_14.xhtml#fig14-7">Figs. 14.7</a>–<a href="chapter_14.xhtml#fig14-8">14.8</a>). One might interpret this cynically as a boon to the elites: the less the lower classes turn out for elections, the easier it is for the upper classes to maintain their hold on power. But in the long run the risk is that this will undermine the legitimacy of elections and of the political regime itself, opening the way to violent revolution and authoritarian government. In a broader sense, it is clear that the whole postwar political cleavage structure and system of electoral coalitions is in danger of collapse. What remains of the “electoral left” is fractured by deeper and deeper rifts between a pro-market center-left and a more radical wing that favors redistribution and seeks new answers to the challenge of rising inequality. I will say more later about how emerging forms of participatory socialism and social federalism might respond to this challenge. The “electoral right” is equally divided between a pro-market center-right and a more radical nativist and nationalist right, which sees identitarian retreat and anti-immigrant social nativism as the proper response to the challenges of a global economic system run amok. We turn next to the new identitarian cleavages, which will lead us to the four-way division of the electorate seen in France in 2017.</p>
</section>
<section epub:type="division">
<h1 class="head a-head"><a id="sec222"/><i>On the Return of Identitarian and Religious Cleavages in France</i></h1>
<p class="noindent">To begin with, note that the existence of important identitarian and religious cleavages is hardly new in France. The division between Catholics and seculars, which partially overlapped conflicts around property and between rural <span aria-label="775" id="pg_775" role="doc-pagebreak"/>peasants and urban workers, played a central role in the nineteenth and much of the twentieth centuries.<sup><a href="#footnote-1375" id="footnote-1375-backlink" role="doc-noteref">87</a></sup> This internal border separating believers from nonbelievers, even within the less advantaged classes, further complicated the task of organizing socioeconomically coherent political coalitions. If classist political cleavages did develop after the war, it was partly because religious and identitarian cleavages had begun to fade. But it was also because the challenges of two world wars, the crisis of the 1930s, and communism had accustomed people to the idea that a higher level of social and economic intervention was needed. This gave the Socialists and the Communists what they needed to win their battle with the Radicals—their rival in the interwar years—and to convince voters that the time had come for new socioeconomic policies. The issue of the property regime then took precedence over boundary questions.</p>
<p>In recent decades, identitarian and religious cleavages of a new type have developed in France and other European countries as anti-immigrant movements have gathered momentum. These movements oppose immigration from outside Europe, especially Muslims from Arab countries. If we look at the evolution of religious practice in France as declared in postelection surveys since 1967,<sup><a href="#footnote-1374" id="footnote-1374-backlink" role="doc-noteref">88</a></sup> we find that the proportion of respondents answering “no religion” has increased significantly, from 6 percent in 1967 to 36 percent in 2017 (<a href="chapter_14.xhtml#fig14-14">Fig. 14.14</a>). A majority of the electorate continues to declare itself Catholic, but its size has shrunk from 91 percent in 1976 to 55 percent in 2017. In other words, Catholics once made up an overwhelming majority of the electorate, but now they are merely a relative majority. If we focus on voters below the age of 50, we find that those without religion outnumber Catholics in the 2012 survey (44 to 42 percent).<sup><a href="#footnote-1373" id="footnote-1373-backlink" role="doc-noteref">89</a></sup> Furthermore, practicing Catholics (defined as those who said <span aria-label="776" id="pg_776" role="doc-pagebreak"/>they went to church at least once a month) have almost totally disappeared: they accounted for less than 6 percent of voters in 2017. The remaining 49 percent claim to have a Catholic identity but practice little if at all.<sup><a href="#footnote-1372" id="footnote-1372-backlink" role="doc-noteref">90</a></sup></p>

<figcaption><p class="FIGT"><small>FIG.</small> 14.14.  The religious structure of the French electorate, 1967–2017</p>
<p class="CAP"><i>Interpretation:</i> From 1967 to 2017, the proportion of the electorate declaring itself to be practicing Catholic (that is, attending church at least once a month) decreased from 25 percent to 6 percent. Nonpracticing Catholics decreased from 66 percent to 49 percent, individuals declaring themselves without religion increased from 6 percent to 36 percent, other religions (Protestant, Jewish, Buddhist, etc., excluding Islam) rose from 3 to 4 percent, and self-declared Muslims rose from 1 to 5 percent. <i>Sources and series:</i> piketty.pse.ens.fr/ideology.</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Not only did the number of people declaring “no religion” increase sharply, but also between 1967 and 2017, there was a smaller but still significant increase in the number of people practicing religions other than Catholic. In 1976, fewer than 3 percent of respondents practiced another religion, mainly Protestant (roughly 2 percent) or Jewish (roughly 0.5 percent); all other religions (Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism, etc.) accounted for less than 0.5 percent. Muslim voters <span aria-label="777" id="pg_777" role="doc-pagebreak"/>still represented less than 1 percent of the electorate in 1988, at which time they began to be counted separately from other religions in postelection surveys. They still represented less than 2 percent of the electorate in 1997, climbing to 3 percent in the elections of 2002 and 2007 and then 5 percent in 2012 and 2017.<sup><a href="#footnote-1371" id="footnote-1371-backlink" role="doc-noteref">91</a></sup> Among voters stating their faith as Muslim, the vast majority appear to practice infrequently, like the vast majority of Catholics.<sup><a href="#footnote-1370" id="footnote-1370-backlink" role="doc-noteref">92</a></sup></p>
<p>To be clear, these numbers apply only to registered voters—hence, French citizens (and therefore likely to be at least second-generation immigrants) who have taken the trouble to register.<sup><a href="#footnote-1369" id="footnote-1369-backlink" role="doc-noteref">93</a></sup> Other surveys suggest that people defining themselves as Muslims represented roughly 6–8 percent of the population residing in France.<sup><a href="#footnote-1368" id="footnote-1368-backlink" role="doc-noteref">94</a></sup> We find comparable levels in other West European countries, specifically the United Kingdom and Germany. The proportion of Muslims in France is smaller than but comparable in magnitude to the proportion of <span aria-label="778" id="pg_778" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Muslims in India (10 percent in the 1951 census, 14 percent in that of 2011), with the important difference that Hindus and Muslims have coexisted in India since the thirteenth century whereas religious pluralism is a relatively recent phenomenon in Western Europe.<sup><a href="#footnote-1367" id="footnote-1367-backlink" role="doc-noteref">95</a></sup> By contrast, the proportion of Muslims is small in Poland, Hungary, or in the United States (less than 1 percent).</p>
<p>What is the effect of religious cleavages on voting? Two facts stand out. First, if we begin by setting aside religions other than Catholic, we find that the gap between Catholic voters and those professing “no religion” has always played a very important role in French politics. This was obviously the case during the Third Republic, especially in the period 1871–1910 studied by Andr<span class="accent">é</span> Siegfried, who among other things looked at the relation between private school attendance, the pattern of land ownership, and the vote for Catholic candidates.<sup><a href="#footnote-1366" id="footnote-1366-backlink" role="doc-noteref">96</a></sup> Religion continued to have a major impact on voting in the period 1960–1980: only 10–20 percent of practicing Catholics voted for parties of the left (Socialists, Communists, Radicals, and Greens), compared with 70–80 percent of voters claiming “no religion” (<a href="chapter_14.xhtml#fig14-15">Fig. 14.15</a>). Nonpracticing Catholics have always occupied an intermediate position between these two groups. To find a socioeconomic factor with an effect on voting as dramatic as that of religion, one would have to compare the vote of the bottom wealth decile with that of the top centile (<a href="chapter_14.xhtml#fig14-13">Fig. 14.13</a>). But not all “no religion” voters are poor, nor are all practicing Catholics rich—far from it.</p>
<p>If we consider all Catholic voters (both practicing and nonpracticing), their propensity to vote for parties of the right in the period 1960–1980 was roughly 40 percentage points higher than that of voters without religion. This is an important and highly statistically significant effect. If we control for all socioeconomic variables, this gap falls to about thirty points. This stems from the fact that Catholics are on average older, better paid, and above all significantly wealthier than “no religion” voters.<sup><a href="#footnote-1365" id="footnote-1365-backlink" role="doc-noteref">97</a></sup> Nevertheless, most of the gap (about three-quarters) appears to be due to political-ideological rather than just socioeconomic factors.<sup><a href="#footnote-1364" id="footnote-1364-backlink" role="doc-noteref">98</a></sup> The roughly thirty- or forty-point difference (after and before applying controls, respectively) persisted throughout the period 1960–1980 but then gradually decreased to twenty to twenty-five points in the <span aria-label="779" id="pg_779" role="doc-pagebreak"/>period 1990–2010. This is still a large gap compared with the ten- to twenty-point gap generally associated with socioeconomic variables (<a href="chapter_14.xhtml#fig14-1">Figs. 14.1</a>–<a href="chapter_14.xhtml#fig14-2">14.2</a>).</p>

<p class="noindent">We turn now to the great upheaval in politics and ideology caused by the advent of new forms of religious diversity in France (and more generally in Western Europe, as we will see later). Historically, religious diversity was associated with a higher vote for the parties of the left. In the 1960s and 1970s, for example, we find that Protestants and Jews had a propensity to vote for the left that fell between that of nonpracticing Catholics and that of voters without religion (<a href="chapter_14.xhtml#fig14-16">Fig. 14.16</a>). These two religious minorities maintained the same intermediate position from the 1960s to the 2010s.<sup><a href="#footnote-1363" id="footnote-1363-backlink" role="doc-noteref">99</a></sup><span aria-label="780" id="pg_780" role="doc-pagebreak"/></p>

<p class="CAP"><i>Interpretation:</i> Voters declaring themselves Muslim were significantly more likely to vote for parties of the left than voters without religion after 1997. Before 1988, Muslims are classified with other religions (Protestant, Jewish, Buddhist, Hindu, etc.) and account for less than 1 percent of the electorate. <i>Sources and series:</i> piketty.pse.ens.fr/ideology.</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As for Muslim voters, whose behavior the postelection surveys allow us to study from 1988 on, we find a much clearer tendency to vote for the left. In the elections of 1988 and 1995, roughly 70–80 percent of Muslims voted for parties of the left—approximately the same as unreligious voters (the small sample size does not allow us to say more). From 1997 on, including the elections of 2002, 2007, 2012, and 2017, we find that Muslim voters voted massively for parties of the left at levels of 80–90 percent in survey after survey (<a href="chapter_14.xhtml#fig14-16">Figs. 14.16</a>–<a href="chapter_14.xhtml#fig14-17">14.17</a>). Although the samples are of limited size, the effects are highly significant, and they recur in election after election. The gap between the vote for left-wing parties of Muslim and non-Muslim voters was roughly 40–50 percentage points throughout the period 1995–2017, with a confidence interval of five points at the end of the period. Only a small part (barely a tenth) of the difference can be explained by other voter characteristics that might account for a left-wing vote (such as lower income or wealth).<sup><a href="#footnote-1362" id="footnote-1362-backlink" role="doc-noteref">100</a></sup></p>

</figure>
<p>These results call for several comments. First, there is no socioeconomic variable that yields a vote as lopsided as the 80–90 percent Muslim vote for parties of the left (except, perhaps, the 80–90 percent vote of the very wealthy for parties of the right in the 1970s: <a href="chapter_14.xhtml#fig14-13">Fig. 14.13</a>). Later, however, we will see that 80–90 percent of African Americans have regularly voted for the Democratic Party in the United States since the 1960s, and 80–90 percent of Muslim voters in the United Kingdom have regularly voted for Labour since the 1980s. In the next chapter, I will discuss the similarities and differences between these different forms of politicization of (perceived) ethno-religious cleavages.</p>
<p>At this stage, note simply that the main explanation for why 80–90 percent of Muslims vote for parties of the left is fairly clear: Muslim voters see the parties of the right as extremely hostile toward them. For decades the Front National (FN), which has won roughly 10–15 percent of the vote in legislative elections and 15–20 percent of the vote in presidential <span aria-label="782" id="pg_782" role="doc-pagebreak"/>elections from the late 1980s to the present (and even as much as 25–30 percent in regional and European elections in 2014–2015), has been overt in its hostility to immigrants from outside Europe, and similar hostility has been evident in the harder-right factions of the more mainstream center-right and right parties. The early successes of the FN in the 1980s came after the party campaigned on an unambiguously nativist platform, announced in a leaflet first distributed before the 1978 legislative elections: “A million unemployed is a million too many immigrants! France and the French first! Vote Front National!” Although the leaflet did not say so, the fact that its vitriol was aimed only at immigrants from outside Europe and not at white Europeans was clear to everyone.</p>
<p>Over the past several decades, the heart of the FN platform has always been to end immigration, close the borders, and reform the code of nationality so that the children of non-European immigrants cannot become French citizens.<sup><a href="#footnote-1361" id="footnote-1361-backlink" role="doc-noteref">101</a></sup> Furthermore, the FN clearly hints that once it is in power, it will be quite possible to “send back” all undesirable immigrants and their offspring, even if it means retroactively stripping citizenship from people whose behavior is deemed unsatisfactory (according to criteria to be set by the new government). It is important to note the extreme vindictiveness of this position, which comes down to redrawing the boundaries of the nation retroactively and expelling individuals who have never lived anywhere but in France. In fact, mass cancellations of citizenship and deportations have been carried out in the past, not only in France and elsewhere in Europe during World War II<sup><a href="#footnote-1360" id="footnote-1360-backlink" role="doc-noteref">102</a></sup> but also in the United States in the 1930s.<sup><a href="#footnote-1359" id="footnote-1359-backlink" role="doc-noteref">103</a></sup> History shows that when people <span aria-label="783" id="pg_783" role="doc-pagebreak"/>are angry, they are sometimes willing even in “democratic” countries to hand control of the government to leaders prepared to resort to such measures. Note, too, that the risks of escalation after a party like the FN comes to power are high, especially since the promises about the economic benefits to be expected from deporting immigrants have no basis in reality.<sup><a href="#footnote-1358" id="footnote-1358-backlink" role="doc-noteref">104</a></sup> To cope with the ensuing frustration, the next step would probably be to attack the stigmatized groups even more harshly, possibly leading to unimaginable levels of civil violence.</p>
<p>In the face of such rhetoric and threats, it is hardly surprising that the people most directly affected (namely, Muslim voters) choose to vote for the parties most diametrically opposed to the far right, namely, the parties of the left. Yet it is striking to see how the advent of ethno-religious diversity in France in the wake of postcolonial immigration in the 1960s and 1970s, followed by the rise of a nativist ideology violently opposed to that diversity in the 1980s and 1990s, totally disrupted the usual structure of political conflict. Traditionally, practicing Catholics were the voters most likely to vote for the right, followed by nonpracticing Catholics, then members of religious minorities (Protestants and Jews), and finally—least likely to vote for the right—people professing “no religion,” who have been voting left in France since the French Revolution. The fact that practicing Muslims, many of whom are quite conservative on issues such as family values, are now more likely to vote for the parties of the left than are people without religion speaks volumes about the magnitude of the upheaval.</p>
<p>Note, too, that in 2013 the Socialist government legalized same-sex marriage, which all the surveys show is disliked by both practicing Catholics and practicing Muslims. But this did not prevent more than 90 percent of Muslim voters from voting for parties of the left and the center in 2017, just as they had done in 2012 and previous elections, before the passage of the law.<sup><a href="#footnote-1357" id="footnote-1357-backlink" role="doc-noteref">105</a></sup> The obvious interpretation is that while the issue of same-sex marriage is important, <span aria-label="784" id="pg_784" role="doc-pagebreak"/>it ultimately carried little weight compared with the existential threat that the FN and its nativist ideology represented in the eyes of Muslim voters.<sup><a href="#footnote-1356" id="footnote-1356-backlink" role="doc-noteref">106</a></sup></p>

<h1 class="head a-head"><a id="sec224"/><i>Religious Cleavages, Cleavages Over Origins: The Discrimination Trap</i></h1>
<p class="noindent">Since 2007, French postelection surveys have included questions about origins. We can therefore distinguish electoral cleavages based on religious identity from those based on family trajectories and immigration. In practice, these are very different, but earlier surveys tell us nothing about how they differ. Take, for example, the results for 2012. Respondents were asked to state whether they had “one or more parents or grandparents of foreign origin.”<sup><a href="#footnote-1355" id="footnote-1355-backlink" role="doc-noteref">107</a></sup> Among registered voters, 72 percent answered that they had no foreign grandparent, while 28 percent said that they had at least one. Of those 28 percent, 19 percent stated that they were of European ancestry (of whom nearly two-thirds came from either Spain, Italy, or Portugal), while 9 percent said they had ancestors outside Europe. In nearly 65 percent of those cases, those ancestors lived in North Africa (Algeria, Tunisia, or Morocco), while about 15 percent were from sub-Saharan Africa, for a total of 80 percent from the African continent.<sup><a href="#footnote-1354" id="footnote-1354-backlink" role="doc-noteref">108</a></sup></p>
<p>Looking now at the structure of the vote, we find that voters of foreign but European origin voted exactly the same way as those without foreign origins: 49 percent preferred the Socialist candidate in the second round of the 2012 election compared with 77 percent of voters of non-European origin (<a href="chapter_14.xhtml#fig14-18">Fig. 14.18</a>). <span aria-label="785" id="pg_785" role="doc-pagebreak"/>This effect is independent of religion, moreover, which is especially important because the relation between non-European origin and religious identity is more complex than one might imagine. For example, of those claiming a North African background, fewer than 60 percent declare themselves to be Muslims.<sup><a href="#footnote-1353" id="footnote-1353-backlink" role="doc-noteref">109</a></sup> From this we can determine that respondents of North African or sub-Saharan African origins voted massively for parties of the left, including not just Muslims but also Christians and those without religion. Interaction between the two dimensions, religion and foreign origins, strengthens this effect. In other words, a voter of North African origin but without religion is much more likely to vote for a party of the left than a voter of French or European ancestry, all other socioeconomic characteristics being equal. But this propensity to vote for the left is even stronger if the voter in question is also Muslim.<sup><a href="#footnote-1352" id="footnote-1352-backlink" role="doc-noteref">110</a></sup></p>

<p class="CAP"><i>Interpretation:</i> In 2012, the Socialist candidate obtained 49 percent of the vote among voters with no foreign origin (no foreign-born grandparent), 49 percent of the vote among voters of European foreign origin (primarily Spain, Italy, or Portugal), and 77 percent among voters of non-European origin (in practice, primarily North Africa and sub-Saharan Africa). <i>Sources and series:</i> piketty.pse.ens.fr/ideology.</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p><span aria-label="786" id="pg_786" role="doc-pagebreak"/>This cumulative effect would make little sense if it were only a matter of individual political preferences (regarding, say, family values or same-sex marriage). The only reasonable explanation is that these voters see the parties of the right, and especially the far right, as especially hostile to Islam. Indeed, there are many reasons to think that this perception is accurate. Anti-Muslim discourse played an important role in European colonial ideology, especially in France, from the early nineteenth century on.<sup><a href="#footnote-1351" id="footnote-1351-backlink" role="doc-noteref">111</a></sup> More generally, it is important to recall the very old roots of today’s nativist ideologies. In the interwar years, fear of what is today called “the great replacement” (the idea that Europe could someday be dominated by foreigners) was an important element of Nazi ideology.<sup><a href="#footnote-1350" id="footnote-1350-backlink" role="doc-noteref">112</a></sup> Before World War I, colonial ideologues (such as Pierre Paul Leroy-Beaulieu in France) propounded the theory that the historical supremacy of the “white race” and “Christian civilization” required the export of Europe’s surplus population to the rest of the world, failing which Europe itself might be invaded and bastardized.<sup><a href="#footnote-1349" id="footnote-1349-backlink" role="doc-noteref">113</a></sup> In France, the far right redefined itself in the period 1950–1980 around the rejection of decolonization. Among its founders were many (including Jean-Marie Le Pen) who had absolutely refused to countenance the end of France’s colonial domination of Algeria. From the <span aria-label="787" id="pg_787" role="doc-pagebreak"/>beginning the FN did particularly well with former French colonists repatriated from Algeria, many of whom settled in the south of France.<sup><a href="#footnote-1348" id="footnote-1348-backlink" role="doc-noteref">114</a></sup> Hostility to the “Muslims” who had won their independence in 1962, putting an end to nearly a century and a half of French rule (1830–1962), was for obvious reasons particularly strong among this group.</p>
<p>Research has shown that Muslims are discriminated against in France and Europe, especially in the job market.<sup><a href="#footnote-1347" id="footnote-1347-backlink" role="doc-noteref">115</a></sup> It is well established that for a given level of education, immigrants from North Africa and sub-Saharan Africa face unusual difficulties in finding work, experience higher unemployment, and are paid less.<sup><a href="#footnote-1346" id="footnote-1346-backlink" role="doc-noteref">116</a></sup> Other recent research has shown that the probability of being called for a job interview is much lower if a Muslim-sounding first name is mentioned on the candidate’s curriculum vitae (CV); this remains true after controlling for educational level, professional experience, and foreign origin.<sup><a href="#footnote-1345" id="footnote-1345-backlink" role="doc-noteref">117</a></sup> To overcome prejudices of this type, comparable with prejudices faced by women and minorities in other countries, various solutions are conceivable, include a quota or “reservations” system like the one India has set up to assist groups historically subject to discrimination. What the Indian experience shows, however, is that quotas can stigmatize certain groups unless one takes care to anticipate their effects. In the French and European context, the risk that quotas would <span aria-label="788" id="pg_788" role="doc-pagebreak"/>exacerbate identity conflicts and hostility to Muslims is real.<sup><a href="#footnote-1344" id="footnote-1344-backlink" role="doc-noteref">118</a></sup> It might be better to impose severe penalties for discrimination on the basis of religion or national origin and to develop means of detecting instances of such discrimination. In any case, it is clear that the advent of postcolonial diversity and the emergence of novel nativist ideologies have given rise to a type of inequality and political conflict unknown in Europe just a few decades ago.</p>

<h1 class="head a-head"><a id="sec225"/><i>Borders and Property: An Electorate Divided Four Ways</i></h1>
<p class="noindent">To review, over the past few decades the electoral left has turned into the Brahmin left, which is itself increasingly divided between a pro-market (center-left) faction and a more radical pro-redistribution faction (some would say that it is simply less right-wing). Meanwhile, the electoral right has split into a pro-market center-right and a nativist and nationalist right. In the end, it is clear that the whole system of “classist” cleavages, together with the left-right political structure of the period 1950–1980, has gradually broken down. Recomposition is currently under way. As we will soon discover by looking at countries other than France, this redefinition of the dimensions of political conflict can take different forms. It would be a mistake to see these developments in a deterministic light. The system of political cleavages can evolve in quite different ways depending on the strategies of the actors and the ability of contending social groups to mobilize support and ideas.</p>
<p>The state of political-ideological conflict in France in the late 2010s illustrates to perfection the indeterminacy and profound instability of the system. Briefly stated, the electorate has fractured into four approximately equal parts: an ideological bloc that can be characterized as egalitarian internationalist, another that can be described as inegalitarian internationalist, a third that can be called inegalitarian nativist, and finally, an egalitarian nativist bloc. This decomposition is crude in part because political conflict is more than two-dimensional and in part because each axis of disagreement includes a subtle gradation of positions and subpositions that cannot be reduced to points on a <span aria-label="789" id="pg_789" role="doc-pagebreak"/>straight line. But the analysis given here, in terms of two principal axes—borders and property—is useful for clarifying ideas.</p>
<p>To divide the electorate along these two dimensions, we can use responses to the following two questions. Postelection surveys asked registered voters whether they agreed or disagreed with the following assertion: “There are too many immigrants in France.” In 2017, 56 percent of respondents said they agreed; 44 percent disagreed.<sup><a href="#footnote-1343" id="footnote-1343-backlink" role="doc-noteref">119</a></sup> In the period 2000–2020 the percentage of those who agreed varied from 50 to 60 percent (versus 40 to 50 percent of those who disagreed), largely as a function of the business cycle. For instance, 61 percent thought there were too many immigrants in 2002; this figure fell to 49 percent in 2007, when unemployment and the vote for the FN touched bottom then rose to 51 percent in 2012 and 56 percent in 2017.<sup><a href="#footnote-1342" id="footnote-1342-backlink" role="doc-noteref">120</a></sup></p>
<p>The second question concerns the reduction of inequality between rich and poor. In the questionnaires, the statement is formulated in deliberately aggressive terms: “To establish social justice, one must take from the rich and give to the poor.” If this had been phrased more mildly, more respondents might have approved, but the advantage of putting it this way is that it divides the electorate into two roughly comparable halves. In 2017, 52 percent agreed that one must “take from the rich and give to the poor” (versus 48 percent who disagreed). The proportion of pro-poor voters (as defined by this question) was 56 percent in 2007 and 60 percent in 2012. The decrease from 2012 to 2017 can be interpreted as a sign of greater acceptance of the claim that tax competition has made redistribution impossible; alternatively, it might reflect disappointment with the results achieved by the incumbent Socialist president.<sup><a href="#footnote-1341" id="footnote-1341-backlink" role="doc-noteref">121</a></sup></p>
<p><span aria-label="790" id="pg_790" role="doc-pagebreak"/>To sum up: in the late 2010s, questions about immigration on the one hand and the rich and poor on the other divided the electorate, in each case, into two parts of roughly equal size. If these two dimensions of political conflict had aligned—that is, if the answers to both questions had been perfectly correlated—the electorate itself would have fallen into two roughly equal parts, and electoral conflict would have been two-sided rather than four-sided.<sup><a href="#footnote-1340" id="footnote-1340-backlink" role="doc-noteref">122</a></sup></p>
<p>But the two dimensions did not align: the answers to the two questions were almost totally uncorrelated so that the electorate can be analyzed as falling into four roughly equal parts (<a href="chapter_14.xhtml#fig14-19">Fig. 14.19</a>). In 2017, 21 percent of voters can be classified as “egalitarian internationalists” (pro-immigrant, pro-poor); 26 percent are “inegalitarian nativists” (anti-immigrant, pro-rich); 23 percent are “inegalitarian internationalists” (pro-immigrant, pro-rich), and 30 percent are “egalitarian nativists” (anti-immigrant, pro-poor). Note in particular that the relative weight of these parts can change rapidly within a few years’ time depending on the state of political debate, notable events, and representation of those events in the media. Furthermore, the imprecision of the survey questions allows us only to identify broad ideological families with fluid boundaries rather than perfectly precise or structured positions. Note, finally, that the small differences in size among the four groups are not statistically significant, especially in 2007 and 2017.<sup><a href="#footnote-1339" id="footnote-1339-backlink" role="doc-noteref">123</a></sup></p>
<p>It so happens that these four ideological “quarters” found almost perfect embodiment in four electoral “quarters” in the first round of the 2017 presidential election (<a href="chapter_14.xhtml#tab14-1">Tab. 14.1</a>). The egalitarian internationalist bloc captured 28 percent of the vote, led by the “radical left” candidate Jean-Luc M<span class="accent">é</span>lenchon and his movement La France Insoumise (LFI) with 20 percent, complemented <span aria-label="791" id="pg_791" role="doc-pagebreak"/>by the candidate of the left wing of the Socialist Party, Beno<span class="accent">î</span>t Hamon, who finished with 6 percent, and two candidates of the far left, with 2 percent.<sup><a href="#footnote-1338" id="footnote-1338-backlink" role="doc-noteref">124</a></sup> It is reasonable to describe this bloc as egalitarian internationalist in the sense that, relative to the three other groups, the 28 percent of the electorate who supported it believe most strongly that France could be more open to immigrants (only 32 percent think that there are too many, compared with 56 percent on average) and that more should be done to redistribute from rich to poor (69 percent of egalitarian internationalists consider this to be desirable, compared with 52 percent on average of all four groups). Note, too, that this is a relatively well-educated group (only Macron’s electorate surpasses it in this dimension and then by only a small margin) but also relatively poorly paid (only Le Pen’s electorate is worse in this respect) and even less wealthy (poorer than Le Pen’s electorate).</p>

<p><span aria-label="792" id="pg_792" role="doc-pagebreak"/>The inegalitarian internationalist bloc won 24 percent of the vote behind the candidacy of Emmanuel Macron, who emerged from the pro-market wing of Fran<span class="accent">ç</span>ois Hollande’s Socialist government (which he served from 2012 to 2016, first as principal economic adviser and then as minister of the economy). His candidacy was backed by his own movement, La R<span class="accent">é</span>publique en Marche (LRM), which was joined by MoDem, a party of the center-right, as well as the more centrist and well-to-do segment of the old Socialist electorate. I call this bloc inegalitarian internationalist, because it was less opposed to immigration than the average voter but definitely not convinced of the need to take from the rich to give to the poor. This group was highly educated as well as both better paid and wealthier than average. As for economic and fiscal policy, its main thrust after coming to power in 2017–2018 was to abolish the wealth tax (ISF) and the progressive tax on capital income, paying for both by increasing indirect taxes on motor fuels, a measure it was forced to rescind in late 2018 to placate the “yellow vests” (see <a href="chapter_13.xhtml">Chapter 13</a>).<sup><a href="#footnote-1337" id="footnote-1337-backlink" role="doc-noteref">125</a></sup></p>
<p>The inegalitarian nativist bloc took 22 percent of the vote behind Fran<span class="accent">ç</span>ois Fillon (20 percent), along with three minor right-wing candidates (2 percent).<sup><a href="#footnote-1336" id="footnote-1336-backlink" role="doc-noteref">126</a></sup> This was the bourgeois and traditional Catholic right, 62 percent of which was hostile to immigration but above all strongly opposed to any redistribution from rich to poor (of which 73 percent wanted no part). Its voters were slightly less well educated than those of the LRM-MoDem bloc, but they were also wealthier and better paid. Destined for victory before being undermined by a corruption scandal, Fillon lost to Macron, and since the election, a significant portion of his electorate has supported Macron’s government, not least because the abolition of the ISF, enacted by Macron, was a symbolic measure that much of the right had wanted for quite some time but had never been able to pass.<sup><a href="#footnote-1335" id="footnote-1335-backlink" role="doc-noteref">127</a></sup></p>
<p><span aria-label="793" id="pg_793" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Finally, the egalitarian nativist bloc took 26 percent of the vote behind the candidacies of Marine Le Pen, who represented the FN (21 percent), and Nicolas Dupont-Aignan, who represented the sovereignist right (5 percent) and who threw his support to Le Pen in the second round. This electorate was more favorable than the average voter to redistribution from rich to poor (61 percent versus 51 percent), but its principal characteristic was extreme hostility to immigrants (91 percent believed that there were too many in France). These voters were also significantly less educated than those of the three other groups (the percentage with tertiary degrees was half that of the others), and their income was the lowest of the four. By contrast, they were somewhat wealthier than those who voted for M<span class="accent">é</span>lenchon and Hamon (but much less wealthy than Macron and Fillon voters).</p>
<p>Finally, it is important to note that the electorate contained a “fifth quarter” not shown in <a href="chapter_14.xhtml#tab14-1">Table 14.1</a>: the abstentionists (22 percent of registered voters did not vote in the first round). This group was characterized by low education and income and much lower wealth than the four voting groups.<sup><a href="#footnote-1334" id="footnote-1334-backlink" role="doc-noteref">128</a></sup> From an ideological standpoint, this was by far the least politicized group; abstainers seldom responded to the survey questions about redistribution and immigration.<sup><a href="#footnote-1334a" id="footnote-1334a-backlink" role="doc-noteref">129</a></sup><span aria-label="794" id="pg_794" role="doc-pagebreak"/></p>

<h1 class="head a-head"><a id="sec226"/><span aria-label="795" id="pg_795" role="doc-pagebreak"/><i>On the Instability of the Four-Way Division of the Electorate</i></h1>
<p class="noindent">This division of the electorate into four quarters calls for several remarks. First, the presidential election of 2017 was clearly the unforeseen culmination of a long process of disintegration of the classist cleavages and left-right divide that defined the period 1950–1980. The two traditional coalitions, the electoral left and electoral right, were now divided by deep social and ideological cleavages. A four-way division of the electorate represents this complexity better than a binary or unidimensional view.</p>
<p>Second, it is quite unusual to find four candidates winning 20–24 percent of the vote each in the first round of an election in which only the top two candidates qualify for the second round. As a general rule, strategic voters will tend to vote for the two candidates leading the pre-election polls. One finds occasional three-way races, but such close four-way contests are extremely rare.<sup><a href="#footnote-1333" id="footnote-1333-backlink" role="doc-noteref">130</a></sup> What this suggests is that the social and ideological differences that led to this four-way division of the electorate were strong enough to overcome the normal urge to vote strategically. In the end, Macron and Le Pen narrowly beat the two other candidates to reach the second round, which therefore pitted the inegalitarian internationalist bloc against the egalitarian nativists.<sup><a href="#footnote-1332" id="footnote-1332-backlink" role="doc-noteref">131</a></sup> Clearly, however, the scores of the four top first-round contenders were so close that any two of the four could have ended up in the second round.</p>
<p>In the future, this four-way division could evolve into a three-way structure organized around three ideological families: liberalism, nationalism, and socialism.<sup><a href="#footnote-1331" id="footnote-1331-backlink" role="doc-noteref">132</a></sup> This could happen if, for instance, the economically more liberal <span aria-label="796" id="pg_796" role="doc-pagebreak"/>segment of Fillon’s electorate were captured by Macron, while the more anti-immigrant segment turned to Le Pen. An evolution along these lines may already have begun, as illustrated by the European elections of 2019.<sup><a href="#footnote-1330" id="footnote-1330-backlink" role="doc-noteref">133</a></sup> In the 2017 election, the ideological divisions among the four quarters of the electorate were sufficiently well defined that each found its own candidate.</p>
<p>Clearly, then, the current system of political cleavages is quite unstable. The principle axis of political-ideological conflict is being redefined, and it is possible to imagine several future trajectories, depending on the ability of contending groups to mobilize and on the depth of their respective convictions and ideas. In the next chapter, we will see that the situation is comparable in the United States. In the 2016 presidential election, for example, the final duel would have been quite different if the Democratic primary process had chosen the pro-redistribution candidate, Bernie Sanders, rather than the centrist Hillary Clinton. As in the 2017 French election, it is hard to say what the outcome would have been if these contests and debates had not taken place; in any case, future political-ideological developments would have probably been deeply affected by them.</p>
<p>The 2017 French election was a turning point, in which the old cleavage structure finally broke down in ways consistent with previous changes, most notably the rise of the Brahmin left and the dual elite. In fact, in the graphs presented in the chapter on the long-term evolution of the socioeconomic structure of the electorate, I defined the electoral left of 2017 as the 52 percent of the electorate that voted for the M<span class="accent">é</span>lenchon/Hamon and Macron blocs, as opposed to the 48 percent who voted for Fillon and Le Pen/Dupont-Aignan. These coalitions were totally artificial: the 2017 contest was more of a four-way battle (<a href="chapter_14.xhtml#tab14-1">Tab. 14.1</a>). But this way of looking at things is useful precisely because it shows that the 52 percent who voted for M<span class="accent">é</span>lenchon, Hamon, or Macron in 2017 were only slightly higher in educational level (and a bit higher still in terms of income and wealth) than the electoral left of 2012 or earlier elections (<a href="chapter_14.xhtml#fig14-1">Figs. 14.1</a> and <a href="chapter_14.xhtml#fig14-10">14.10</a>–<a href="chapter_14.xhtml#fig14-11">14.11</a>).<sup><a href="#footnote-1329" id="footnote-1329-backlink" role="doc-noteref">134</a></sup> What took place in 2017 was thus the culmination of <span aria-label="797" id="pg_797" role="doc-pagebreak"/>a process already under way for several decades. The outcome revealed just how unstable the new dual-elite configuration is. The wealthier segment of the Brahmin left voted for Macron, consummating the break with the less wealthy segment of the old electoral left, which turned to either M<span class="accent">é</span>lenchon or Hamon. The old electoral right, which really ceased to be a viable electoral coalition once the FN and nativist ideology moved to center stage, seems more divided than ever between pro-market and anti-immigrant camps.</p>

<section epub:type="division">
<h1 class="head a-head"><a id="sec227"/><i>Yellow Vests, Carbon, and the Wealth Tax: The Social-Nativist Trap in France</i></h1>
<p class="noindent">There are of course several different ways of describing the recompositions currently under way and developments that may occur in the future. The new electoral bloc that has formed around Macron and the LRM and MoDem can be seen as a “bourgeois bloc” that will reconcile the Brahmin left with the merchant right.<sup><a href="#footnote-1328" id="footnote-1328-backlink" role="doc-noteref">135</a></sup> In sociological terms, it is quite clear that this coalition brings together the most highly educated, best paid, and wealthiest voters of both the center-left and center-right. Some would describe the new coalition as “progressive.” They like this term because it can be contrasted with “nationalist”: progressives see nationalists as “backward” because they reject both globalization and Europe and because their aggressive attitudes and “deplorable passions” encourage hostility not only to immigrants but also to “entrepreneurs.” Progressives particularly resent it when these “backward” opponents attack entrepreneurs as “fat cats” who should be required to pay their fair share, whereas in the progressive view the entrepreneurial class creates jobs and therefore diligently contributes to the common good.</p>
<p>Interestingly, this way of looking at the political battlefield as a clash between progressives and nationalists is also favored by the nativist camp, which is only too glad to reverse the terms so that the nativists are the good guys and the progressives the bad.<sup><a href="#footnote-1327" id="footnote-1327-backlink" role="doc-noteref">136</a></sup> For Le Pen and the FN, the new conflict is between globalists and patriots. Globalists are nomadic elites, without roots, always <span aria-label="798" id="pg_798" role="doc-pagebreak"/>ready to squeeze workers and hire cheap immigrant labor while patriots defend the interests of the less advantaged classes against the threats of hypercapitalist mongrelized globalization without borders or fatherland. The problem is that this binary vision of political conflict, which suits those who place themselves at the center of the contest, is both misleading and dangerous.</p>
<p>It is misleading because the reality of the current political-ideological conflict in France and most other countries is profoundly multidimensional. In particular, the electorate contains an egalitarian internationalist bloc, whose shape and size varies with context. More than the other segments of the electorate, it champions both internationalism and equality, defending immigrant workers of all origins and promoting redistribution of wealth from rich to poor. Can this camp attract a majority? The question is as open today as it has always been. The answer depends on whether it is possible to develop what I call a social-federalist platform, by which I mean a program designed to enable redistribution and internationalism to reinforce each other. To ignore this possibility, to think that political conflict in the future will inevitably pit progressives against nationalists (or globalists against patriots), is to forget that electorates are often divided four ways (or sometime three ways), as in France in 2017–2019. Not only can four-way divisions evolve in any number of directions, but also the boundaries dividing these four groups are porous and changeable.</p>
<p>More than that, binary division (progressive-nationalist or globalist-patriot) is dangerous, because it casts nativist ideology with its potential for violence as the only possible alternative. The aim of such a rhetorical strategy is of course to keep the “progressives” in power indefinitely. In reality, however, it runs the risk of hastening the success of the “nationalists,” especially if they are able to develop a social-nativist ideology: in other words, an ideology combining social and egalitarian objectives for the “native” population with violent exclusion of “nonnatives” (like the Democratic Party in the United States in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries).<sup><a href="#footnote-1326" id="footnote-1326-backlink" role="doc-noteref">137</a></sup> The ideology of the FN has been moving in this direction for several decades now, and the risk is that the events of 2017–2019 (especially the “yellow vests” crisis) will accelerate the transfor<span aria-label="799" id="pg_799" role="doc-pagebreak"/>mation. In the 1980s, the FN was already aggressively anti-immigrant, but in social and economic dimensions its ideology was relatively elitist, which made it less dangerous. Specifically, the party continues to bears traces of the Poujadist antitax influence of its early years: until the late 1980s it called for complete elimination of the income tax.<sup><a href="#footnote-1325" id="footnote-1325-backlink" role="doc-noteref">138</a></sup> Then, in the 1990s and 2000s, the FN took a social turn, stepping up its defense of low-wage workers and of the system of social protection (provided it was reserved for the native-born). At a time when the Brahmin left seemed to be abandoning the disadvantaged classes, this helped to expand the FN’s electoral base.<sup><a href="#footnote-1324" id="footnote-1324-backlink" role="doc-noteref">139</a></sup> So, for example, in 2017–2019 the FN first opposed abolition of the wealth tax and then called for its restoration, whereas it had itself favored the elimination of all forms of progressive taxation only a few decades earlier.</p>
<p>Of course, the sincerity and depth of the FN’s conversion on social and fiscal matters should not be overstated; it owed a great deal to opportunism. Basically, the FN program emphasizes the exclusion of immigrants and the endless benefits to be expected from such exclusion, and the nationalist retreat it favors would likely lead to increased fiscal dumping for the benefit of the rich, as has happened in the United States since the election of Donald Trump (I will come back to this). Nevertheless, this rhetoric could pay off, and the risk of France’s falling into a social-nativist trap as a result of the Macron government’s uninhibited pursuit of policies favorable to the wealthy is quite real. The fact that the carbon tax increases of 2017–2018 (ultimately rescinded in 2019) actually served to finance not the ecological transition but the abolition of the wealth tax (and other taxes on the wealthy) tends to validate the allegations of hypocrisy that nativists have traditionally directed at “globalists.”</p>

<section epub:type="division">
<h1 class="head a-head"><a id="sec228"/><i>Europe and the Disadvantaged Classes: The Grounds for a Divorce</i></h1>
<p class="noindent">The policies that have been pursued since 2017, and especially the way in which the issue of the European Union has been instrumentalized to justify tax cuts for the wealthy, also increase the risk that the middle and disadvantaged classes <span aria-label="800" id="pg_800" role="doc-pagebreak"/>will form an anti-European front in years to come. Of course, there is nothing new about instrumentalizing Europe for the benefit of the wealthy. As noted earlier, the complete liberalization of capital flows, without common fiscal regulation or automatic sharing of information about cross-border financial asset holdings, has contributed to escalating fiscal competition to the advantage of the mobile since the 1980s. The perception of the European Union as a place of competition of all against all, of benefit primarily to the upper classes, helps to explain the disaffection of the disadvantaged, which manifested itself in France during the 1992 referendum on the Maastricht Treaty and then again in the 2005 referendum on the European Constitutional Treaty.</p>
<p>These two elections are important because they reveal the depths of the divorce. In the 1992 referendum, which was primarily about creating the euro, “yes” won by a slim margin, 51 to 49 percent, thanks mainly to a last-minute intervention by the Socialist president after several polls predicted a victory for “no.” The fact remains that the outcome depended entirely on the vote of the privileged classes. Data from postelection surveys shows clearly that the 30 percent of voters with the highest levels of education, income, and wealth voted heavily for “yes,” while the 60 percent at the bottom voted clearly for “no” (<a href="chapter_14.xhtml#fig14-20">Fig. 14.20</a>). The 2005 referendum was about bringing the various European treaties together in a single treaty that would serve as a constitution for the European Union based on the principles of “free and undistorted competition,” free circulation of capital, goods, and people, and continuation of the rule of unanimity on fiscal matters (which would thus have been institutionally enshrined). It was curtly rejected by French voters, 55 to 45 percent. The available data show that the top 20 percent (and especially the top 10 percent) in terms of education, income, and wealth voted “yes” with a large margin in 2005, whereas the bottom 80 percent massively favored “no.”</p>
<p>These two referenda are revealing because the very clear “classist” structure of the vote, regardless of the dimension considered (education, income, or wealth), was different from that of the left-right blocs that still existed at the time. It was the well-to-do of the center-left and center-right, the “Brahmin left” and “merchant right,” who came together to push the European project forward, well before the attempt to form a political alliance in the shape of a “bourgeois bloc” that one saw in 2017.</p>
<p>How to explain this divorce between the disadvantaged classes (in the broadest sense) and the construction of the European Union? The most plausible explanation, in my view, is the (largely justified) perception that the European Single Market primarily benefited the most powerful actors and the most advantaged social groups. Indeed, it is difficult to deny that tax <span aria-label="801" id="pg_801" role="doc-pagebreak"/>competition among the countries of Europe has led them to distort their tax structures in such a way as to benefit of the most mobile actors to the detriment of the disadvantaged.<sup><a href="#footnote-1323" id="footnote-1323-backlink" role="doc-noteref">140</a></sup> The idea that the socially disadvantaged are spontaneously and irrationally nationalist (or even racist), which conveniently allows “progressive” elites to justify their civilizing mission, can scarcely withstand analysis. For example, the postelection survey of 1958 contains questions about maintaining French colonial rule in Algeria and West Africa. In both cases we find that workers were the most likely to favor immediate independence in keeping with the egalitarian internationalism championed at the time by the Communist and Socialist Parties. The highly educated took a wait-and-see attitude, while the self-employed were the most supportive of keeping Algeria French and continuing French colonial rule in Africa (perhaps because they identified more with the repatriated colonists and the property they had lost in the colonies).<sup><a href="#footnote-1322" id="footnote-1322-backlink" role="doc-noteref">141</a></sup> The poor are no more spontaneously nationalistic than the rich: nationalism is historically, socially, and politically constructed and deconstructed.</p>

<figcaption><p class="FIGT"><small>FIG.</small> 14.20.  The European cleavage in France: The 1992 and 2005 referenda</p>
<p class="CAP"><i>Interpretation:</i> In the 1992 referendum on the Maastricht treaty (“yes” won with 51 percent) as in the 2005 referendum on the European Constitutional Treaty (“yes” lost with 45 percent), the vote was strongly skewed socially: the top income, education, and wealth deciles voted strongly for “yes,” while the bottom deciles voted for “no.” <i>Note:</i> D1 refers to the bottom decile, D2 to the next, and D10 to the top. <i>Sources and series:</i> piketty.pse.ends.fr/ideology.</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p><span aria-label="802" id="pg_802" role="doc-pagebreak"/>After such socially skewed votes, and especially after the rejection of the European Constitutional Treaty in 2005, one might have thought that there would be a change of political direction in France and Europe. Until the European Union is clearly and visibly seen to serve the cause of social and fiscal justice (for instance, by imposing a European tax on high incomes and large fortunes), it is difficult to imagine an end to the bitter divorce that has alienated the disadvantaged classes from the European project.<sup><a href="#footnote-1321" id="footnote-1321-backlink" role="doc-noteref">142</a></sup></p>

<h1 class="head a-head"><a id="sec229"/><i>On the Neo-Proprietarian Instrumentalization of Europe</i></h1>
<p class="noindent">Unfortunately, no reorientation of this sort took place. The main provisions of the (rejected) 2005 European Constitutional Treaty were incorporated into the Treaty of Lisbon (2007), which, in order to avoid the hurdle of another referendum, was put to a vote by the French National Assembly, which duly ratified it. To be sure, the “no” coalition is itself full of contradictions and did not propose any specific alternative draft that might have served as the basis of a new treaty. Still, it is dangerous to so willfully ignore a verdict so clearly expressed at the ballot box and to refuse to countenance any constructive political alternative (such as a more just tax system). In the 2012 French presidential election, the Socialist candidate vaguely evoked the possibility of renegotiating the new budget treaty (Treaty on Stability, Coordination, and Governance), signed only a few months earlier, which had led to a considerable tightening of deficit rules.<sup><a href="#footnote-1320" id="footnote-1320-backlink" role="doc-noteref">143</a></sup> But in the end nothing came of this discussion, which was not based on any precise proposal on the French side.</p>
<p><span aria-label="803" id="pg_803" role="doc-pagebreak"/>What has happened over the past few years has only widened the breach between the European Union and the disadvantaged classes. In particular, the Macron government (elected in 2017) calls itself pro-European but, like its predecessors, has instrumentalized the European project in the service of policies that quite blatantly favor the rich. In the fall of 2017, the new government enacted two fiscal measures: it transformed the wealth tax (<i>impôt sur la fortune,</i> or ISF) into a real estate tax (<i>impôt sur la fortune immobilière,</i> or IFI) and instituted a flat tax on capital income (in place of the progressive tax on wages and other income). Both measures were largely described as a response to European competition. To be sure, the president also justified both measures by invoking a metaphor of Alpine climbers, in which the person “at the head of the rope” pulls up everyone else on his team: in other words, tax cuts for the rich (portrayed by the president as the most deserving and useful members of society) will eventually find their way to the rest of the population. This was a French version of Ronald Reagan’s trickle-down economics of the 1980s or the portrayal of the rich as “job creators” by Donald Trump and the Republican Party. Still, the French context being very different from the American, one may doubt that Macron’s rope-climber ideology would by itself have led to the fiscal measures of 2017 without the additional argument that European tax competition made reform imperative.<sup><a href="#footnote-1319" id="footnote-1319-backlink" role="doc-noteref">144</a></sup></p>
<p>It is important to add that, despite the government’s rhetoric, these two tax reforms are quite unpopular in France. Every opinion poll conducted in 2018–2019 shows that the vast majority of respondents favored reinstating the ISF. But the government has stood firm, explicitly using Europe as a pretext and thereby running the risk of exacerbating hostility to the kind of European integration it favors.</p>
<p>As for the ISF, another argument was advanced in support of the government’s reform: namely, the idea that financial assets are by their very nature more likely to promote job creation than nonfinancial assets (like real estate). The problem with this argument is that it makes no sense: financial investments in other countries create no jobs in France, whereas the construction of a house or apartment building creates jobs at once. As a general rule, there is no connection between the legal form of an investment (financial asset or real estate <span aria-label="804" id="pg_804" role="doc-pagebreak"/>asset) and its social or economic efficiency.<sup><a href="#footnote-1318" id="footnote-1318-backlink" role="doc-noteref">145</a></sup> By contrast, there is a very clear connection with wealth: nearly all of the largest fortunes are held in the form of financial assets so that exempting financial assets from the ISF is tantamount to abolishing the wealth tax on the wealthiest individuals without clearly saying so while pretending that the goal was to stimulate new investment and job creation.<sup><a href="#footnote-1317" id="footnote-1317-backlink" role="doc-noteref">146</a></sup></p>
<p>In reality, the only logically plausible justification for exempting financial assets is of an entirely different nature: it is based on the idea that financial assets cannot be taxed because they can magically disappear and thus avoid the tax collector. This was in fact the key argument that was widely invoked. If it were true, the implication would be that the only option is a regressive tax falling solely on the real estate of the middle class because financial assets, where the wealthy put most of their money, are impossible to tax. This belief, profoundly nihilistic and pessimistic as to our collective capacity to create just rules and institutions, poses two major problems. First, the assertion that huge amounts of financial assets were spirited out of France in order to avoid the wealth tax (ISF) is not supported by any serious evidence. Even though enforcement of the ISF was far from perfect, the fact is that the number and amount of assets have increased significantly since the 1990s. Indeed, the value of financial assets declared by people in the highest tax brackets has increased even more sharply than the value of real estate, which has itself increased more rapidly than gross domestic product (GDP) and income in recent decades.<sup><a href="#footnote-1316" id="footnote-1316-backlink" role="doc-noteref">147</a></sup> Total <span aria-label="805" id="pg_805" role="doc-pagebreak"/>receipts from the ISF quadrupled between 1990 and 2018, while nominal GDP only doubled.<sup><a href="#footnote-1315" id="footnote-1315-backlink" role="doc-noteref">148</a></sup> This increase also reflects a general rise in the level and concentration of wealth (and especially in the size of the largest financial portfolios) throughout the world since the 1980s.<sup><a href="#footnote-1314" id="footnote-1314-backlink" role="doc-noteref">149</a></sup> In any case, the point is that the assumption of a massive capital flight induced by ISF does not stand.</p>
<p>Last but not least, even if we assume that financial assets flowed out of France (which they definitely did not), the logical conclusion is that the French government should have taken steps to combat the practice. It is totally baseless to assume that nothing can be done to register or monitor financial assets. Financial institutions are legally required to transmit information about interest and dividends to the tax authorities. In France, taxpayers receive income tax statements with information about their income from various sources already filled in, but this practice has never been extended to wealth tax statements even though French banks know about the financial assets they hold for their clients. This is a political choice, not a technical necessity.<sup><a href="#footnote-1313" id="footnote-1313-backlink" role="doc-noteref">150</a></sup> There is no reason why pre-filled wealth tax statements could not have been introduced in France (which would have broadened the coverage of the ISF and increased returns even more); meanwhile, the government could have worked harder to encourage adoption of a similar tax by other countries. To that end, it could have pressed for new treaties on the free circulation of capital requiring automatic transmission of data to the tax authorities; the United States imposed such <span aria-label="806" id="pg_806" role="doc-pagebreak"/>requirements on Switzerland and other countries in 2010.<sup><a href="#footnote-1312" id="footnote-1312-backlink" role="doc-noteref">151</a></sup> As for residential and professional assets located in France and, more generally, the assets of firms doing business or having economic interests in France, it is up to the French government alone to decide whether their owners must register with the tax authorities.<sup><a href="#footnote-1311" id="footnote-1311-backlink" role="doc-noteref">152</a></sup> The fact that the French government did not undertake any of these reforms demonstrates quite clearly that, for political and ideological reasons, it had other objectives, even if it tried to hide these behind a facade of technical objections (which served only to heighten suspicion of its motives).</p>
<p>Recall that heavy progressive taxes were often levied on large concentrations of financial wealth in the twentieth century—for example, in Germany, Japan, and other countries after World War II; this alleviated public debt and created space for investment in the future.<sup><a href="#footnote-1310" id="footnote-1310-backlink" role="doc-noteref">153</a></sup> And it was done without the benefit of today’s information technology. At a time when rising inequality and rapid climate change threaten the entire planet, to say that financial assets cannot be taxed because their owners cannot be forced to comply with the law is both unconscionable and a sign of historical ignorance. In any case, it is dangerous to instrumentalize European tax competition and EU and international treaties in order to promote policies biased in favor of the rich. Doing so can only stir up anti-EU and anti-globalization sentiments and sow disillusionment about the very possibility of a just economy. This is precisely the kind of nihilism that encourages identitarian retreat and leads straight into the social-nativist trap. We will soon consider the conditions under which this fate might be avoided, but first we must look beyond France and analyze the extent to which the transformations of the political cleavage structure that we have observed there can also be found elsewhere.</p>

<li role="doc-endnote"><p class="FN"><span class="fn_tx">    <a href="#footnote-1454-backlink" id="footnote-1454">8</a></span>.  For the United States we rely on the American National Election Studies (ANES), which have been conducted since 1948. For the United Kingdom the most complete accounts are those of the British Election Study (BES). In France, most of the surveys since 1958 have been conducted in partnership with the Fondation Nationale des Sciences Politiques (FNSP) and its various research centers (especially Le Centre de recherches politiques de Sciences Po, known as CEVIPOF). The files are archived and available through various portals, such as the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR); ANES; Centre de donn<span class="fn_accent">é</span>es socio-politiques (CDSP)/Archives de donn<span class="fn_accent">é</span>es issues de la statistique publique (ADISP), and the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems (CSES). These postelection studies should not be confused with exit polls, which usually rely on shorter, more rudimentary questionnaires, although sometimes larger samples are used as in the National Exit Polls (NEP) conducted in the United States since 1972, which I used as a check of the robustness of the results obtained with the ANES.

<li role="doc-endnote"><p class="FN"><span class="fn_tx">    <a href="#footnote-1453-backlink" id="footnote-1453">9</a></span>.  Detailed results from the analysis of these survey data, along with computer code for transforming the raw data into the series presented here, are available in the online appendix.

<li role="doc-endnote"><p class="FN"><span class="fn_tx">  <a href="#footnote-1452-backlink" id="footnote-1452">10</a></span>.  In practice, for periods prior to World War II, one can compare voting data at the local level (towns, counties, etc.) with census data or administrative or tax records also available at the local level. This geo-electoral method has its limits (since there is no information about individual voting), but it is the only way to push the investigation further back in time. Later I will discuss some examples of using this method, which Andr<span class="fn_accent">é</span> Siegfried magisterially pioneered in 1913.</p></li>
<li role="doc-endnote"><p class="FN"><span class="fn_tx">  <a href="#footnote-1451-backlink" id="footnote-1451">11</a></span>.  The confidence intervals are slightly larger at the beginning of the period because of the smaller sample sizes (<i>n</i> = 2,000–3,000 rather than <i>n</i> = 4,000–5,000). They are not shown on subsequent graphs to simplify the presentation, but one should keep in mind that small variations of two to three points or less are generally not significant.</p></li>
<li role="doc-endnote"><p class="FN"><span class="fn_tx">  <a href="#footnote-1450-backlink" id="footnote-1450">12</a></span>.  For example, the effects of education in <a href="chapter_14.xhtml#fig14-1">Figs. 14.1</a>–<a href="chapter_14.xhtml#fig14-2">14.2</a> are measured after controlling for other factors (including sex, age, family situation, income, and wealth). Similarly, the income effects shown in <a href="chapter_14.xhtml#fig14-1">Fig. 14.1</a> control for sex, age, family situation, education, and wealth. The same is true of wealth effects. The evolutions would be similar in the absence of controls but are reinforced when we take controls into account. See the online appendix, Figs. S14.1a and S14.2a, as well as the discussion below.</p></li>
<li role="doc-endnote"><p class="FN"><span class="fn_tx">  <a href="#footnote-1449-backlink" id="footnote-1449">13</a></span>.  For instance, the Communist vote was underrepresented in French surveys from the 1950s and 1960s, primarily to the benefit of the Socialist vote, with a total left-wing vote virtually identical to the result actually observed. The vote for the (far right) Front National was understated in surveys and polls in the 1990s and 2000s but is barely understated at all in the 2010s.</p></li>
<li role="doc-endnote"><p class="FN"><span class="fn_tx">  <a href="#footnote-1448-backlink" id="footnote-1448">14</a></span>.  The survey data are generally reweighted to reproduce the exact results of the vote (while preserving the national representativeness and sociodemographic structure of the sample), and the reweighted data are used to estimate the results presented here. The observed trends in differentials by education, income, wealth, etc., are identical if one uses the raw (un-reweighted) data. See the online appendix.</p></li>
<li role="doc-endnote"><p class="FN"><span class="fn_tx">  <a href="#footnote-1447-backlink" id="footnote-1447">15</a></span>.  See the online appendix, Figs. S14.1b–S14.1c and S14.12b–S14.2c.</p></li>
<li role="doc-endnote"><p class="FN"><span class="fn_tx">  <a href="#footnote-1446-backlink" id="footnote-1446">16</a></span>.  Specifically, the correlation coefficients between level of education, income, and wealth appear to be relatively stable according to postelection survey data from France, the United States, and United Kingdom over the period 1948–2017 (with coefficients of 0.3–0.4 for education and income, 0.2–0.3 for income and wealth, and 0.1–0.2 for education and wealth). A coefficient of zero indicates no correlation, while a coefficient of one indicates perfect correlation. See the online appendix. Because of the limited number of observations and the imperfection of the variables available for the different dimensions, however, this source tends to slightly underestimate these correlations and does not allow us to identify possible changes within this overall stability. More refined data (not including electoral variables) suggests a possible increase in these correlations since the 1980s. I will come back to this.</p></li>
<li role="doc-endnote"><p class="FN"><span class="fn_tx">  <a href="#footnote-1445-backlink" id="footnote-1445">17</a></span>.  See S. Lipset and S. Rokkan, “Cleavage Structures, Party Systems and Voter Alignments: An Introduction,” in <i>Party Systems and Voter Alignments: Cross-national Perspectives,</i> ed. S. Lipset and S. Rokkan (Free Press, 1967).</p></li>
<li role="doc-endnote"><p class="FN"><span class="fn_tx">  <a href="#footnote-1444-backlink" id="footnote-1444">18</a></span>.  On the role played by the Liberal Party, progressive taxation, and the Irish question in the transformation of British politics in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, see <a href="chapter_5.xhtml">Chap. 5</a>.</p></li>
<li role="doc-endnote"><p class="FN"><span class="fn_tx">  <a href="#footnote-1443-backlink" id="footnote-1443">19</a></span>.  In particular, the notion of “working class,” which is often used in the study of evolving political cleavages based on postelection surveys, clearly does not have the same meaning in a society where industry accounts for 40 percent of employment as in one where it accounts for only 10 percent. Educational, income, and wealth deciles may not be as meaningful at any given moment as the occupational categories often used, but they allow us to compare societies that would otherwise be incomparable. Ideally, both sets of terminology could be used together. I will come back to this.</p></li>
<li role="doc-endnote"><p class="FN"><span class="fn_tx">  <a href="#footnote-1442-backlink" id="footnote-1442">20</a></span>.  The approach that Lipset and Rokkan introduced in the 1960s is largely centered on European—indeed northern European—party systems (as they developed in the nineteenth and first half of the twentieth centuries), partly because of the influence of Rokkan, a Norwegian, and probably also because Lipset, an American, was hoping for a gradual attenuation of racial cleavages.</p></li>
<li role="doc-endnote"><p class="FN"><span class="fn_tx">  <a href="#footnote-1441-backlink" id="footnote-1441">21</a></span>.  For example, the numbering of successive US party systems since its independence is a specifically American exercise. There are of course good reasons for this, given the obvious idiosyncrasies of the US trajectory. See <a href="chapter_6.xhtml">Chap. 6</a> for a rapid presentation of the US party systems.</p></li>
<li role="doc-endnote"><p class="FN"><span class="fn_tx">  <a href="#footnote-1440-backlink" id="footnote-1440">22</a></span>.  In particular, the very interesting work devoted to the rise of anti-immigrant parties and cleavages over identity and migration in Europe (in some cases going so far as to introduce this new systemic cleavage dimension into the Lipset-Rokkan framework) generally do not refer to the role of racial cleavages in the development of the US party system. See, for example, S. Bornschier, <i>Cleavage Politics and the Populist Right</i> (Temple University Press, 2010). See also H. Kitschelt, <i>The Transformation of European Social Democracy</i> (Cambridge University Press, 1994); H. Kitschelt, <i>The Radical Right in Western Europe</i> (University of Michigan Press, 1995).</p></li>
<li role="doc-endnote"><p class="FN"><span class="fn_tx">  <a href="#footnote-1439-backlink" id="footnote-1439">23</a></span>.  The US system (single-round uninominal) tends to concentrate votes on the candidates of the two leading parties, whereas the French system (two-round uninominal) allows a larger number of parties to emerge and persist. Two classic studies of electoral systems and party systems are M. Duverger, <i>Les partis politiques</i> (Armand Colin, 1951), and A. Lijphart, <i>Electoral Systems and Party Systems: A Study of Twenty-Seven Democracies, 1945–1990</i> (Oxford University Press, 1994).</p></li>
<li role="doc-endnote"><p class="FN"><span class="fn_tx">  <a href="#footnote-1438-backlink" id="footnote-1438">24</a></span>.  All postelection surveys in France since 1950 include questions about the left-right position of the various political parties (usually on a scale of 1–7 or 1–10). On the basis of the average score assigned by voters, the Communist Party is unambiguously to the left of the Socialist Party, followed by the parties of the center, center-right, right, and finally, extreme right. Voters also position themselves in the same way: Communist voters place themselves to the left of Socialist voters, who place themselves to the left of centrist voters, and so on. See the online appendix.</p></li>
<li role="doc-endnote"><p class="FN"><span class="fn_tx">  <a href="#footnote-1437-backlink" id="footnote-1437">25</a></span>.  In the 2017 legislative elections, the coalition of La R<span class="fn_accent">é</span>publique en Marche (LREM) and Le Mouvement D<span class="fn_accent">é</span>mocratique (MoDem), which won 32 percent of the first-round vote, was classified by voters as centrist (relative to the other parties), and in <a href="chapter_14.xhtml#fig14-3">Figs. 14.3</a>–<a href="chapter_14.xhtml#fig14-5">14.5</a> I have divided its vote equally between center-right and center-left. I will come back to this point.</p></li>
<li role="doc-endnote"><p class="FN"><span class="fn_tx">  <a href="#footnote-1436-backlink" id="footnote-1436">26</a></span>.  I mainly used the results of the first rounds of legislative elections (because some seats are filled after the first round and there is no second-round vote) and the results of the second rounds of presidential elections (in which turnout is higher). When legislative elections took place in the same year and the presidential election ended in a left-right duel, the results shown in <a href="chapter_14.xhtml#fig14-1">Figs. 14.1</a>–<a href="chapter_14.xhtml#fig14-2">14.2</a> (and after) concern the second round of the presidential election (for example, for 2012, with almost identical results for the legislatives). The 2017 presidential election was a key turning point, for which I used the votes from the first round. I will say more about this later.</p></li>
<li role="doc-endnote"><p class="FN"><span class="fn_tx">  <a href="#footnote-1435-backlink" id="footnote-1435">27</a></span>.  The first French presidential election with universal (male) suffrage took place in 1848, but the winner decided to crown himself emperor and eliminate elections entirely. Between 1871 and 1962 the president was elected by the legislature and had limited powers. Election of the president by universal suffrage was restored by General Charles de Gaulle in 1962 by referendum and applied since 1965; the powers of the presidency were strengthened as well. In contrast to legislative elections (where all candidates winning more than 12.5 percent of the registered electorate in the first round can remain in the running), only the two top candidates can continue on to the second round in the presidential.</p></li>
<li role="doc-endnote"><p class="FN"><span class="fn_tx">  <a href="#footnote-1434-backlink" id="footnote-1434">28</a></span>.  The turnout rates shown are for the first round of legislative elections and the second round of presidential elections (which are generally higher, for the reasons indicated above).</p></li>
<li role="doc-endnote"><p class="FN"><span class="fn_tx">  <a href="#footnote-1433-backlink" id="footnote-1433">29</a></span>.  Note a peak of 58 percent when Obama was first elected in 2008. The turnout rates for the United States in <a href="chapter_14.xhtml#fig14-7">Fig. 14.7</a> are for presidential elections. Participation in senate and congressional elections is generally much lower (especially in midterms).</p></li>
<li role="doc-endnote"><p class="FN"><span class="fn_tx">  <a href="#footnote-1432-backlink" id="footnote-1432">30</a></span>.  More precisely, due to sample sizes and data limitations, participation rates look similar in terms of income, education, and wealth. More complete data might reveal larger gaps for one dimension or another. Note, too, that the participation gaps shown for France concern presidential elections and are still higher for legislative elections (12–15 percentage points in 2012–2017 for the gap between the top and bottom 50 percent, a level virtually identical to that observed in the United States and higher than in the United Kingdom).

The gap even became slightly negative in the United States between 1980 and 1984: voters aged 18–34 were slightly more likely to vote for Reagan than were those over age 65, which is the only example of this type of reversal in any US, French, or UK election in the period 1948–2017. By contrast, the vote gap in favor of Labour between those aged 18–34 and those over age 65 rose to nearly 40 percentage points in 2015–2017, compared with 25–30 points for the French left in the 1970s and 15–20 points for the Democrats in the 1960s (as well as in 2008–2012). The size of these gaps remains roughly the same after controlling for socioeconomic variables (such as sex, education, wealth, parents’ occupation, etc.) but decreases sharply if one controls for religion and religious practices, with the coefficients of some variables even changing signs, as in France in recent years: among declared Catholics, younger people (who are admittedly rare) are more likely to vote for the right than older people.

By contrast, controlling for religion and religious practice practically eliminates this effect entirely: among declared believers, women were not more likely to vote for the right than men. It may be that more overt religiosity among women in the 1950s and 1960s was itself linked to a system of beliefs about the maternal role in family life and child-rearing.

The Alford index was very high in all Western countries in the 1950s and 1960s (as high as 40–50 percentage points in Nordic countries like Sweden and Norway, where the social-democratic vote among workers was as high as 70–80 percent). It gradually decreased in the 1980s and 1990s and dropped to almost zero in the 2000s and 2010s (in some cases even going negative). See R. Alford, “A Suggested Index of the Association of Social Class and Voting,” <i>Public Opinion Quarterly,</i> 1962; S. Bartolini, <i>The Political Mobilization of the European Left, 1860–1980: The Class Cleavage</i> (Cambridge University Press, 2000); G. Evans, <i>The End of Class Politics?

Norris, <i>Trump, Brexit and the Rise of Populism</i> (Harvard University, HKS Working Paper No. RWP16–026, August 2016), fig. 7. The limitation of this type of index is that the definition of “worker” varies widely by country and period, and the proportion of the working population so classified has also evolved substantially over time.</p></li>
<li role="doc-endnote"><p class="FN"><span class="fn_tx">  <a href="#footnote-1415-backlink" id="footnote-1415">47</a></span>.  More specifically, the tendencies indicated in <a href="chapter_14.xhtml#fig14-11">Figs. 14.11</a> and S14.11c–S14.11d are not affected by including controls for sector of activity (public, private, and self-employed) or occupational category (blue-collar, white-collar, supervisory, and other).

But both electorates shifted toward the more highly educated to a similar degree (at least to a first approximation and allowing for the limited sample sizes, which limit what it is possible to say), and the overall evolution was accelerated by the shrinking size of the Communist share of the vote. In any case, the central fact is that one observes the same reversal of the educational cleavage in countries where the electoral left was never structured in this way (such as the United States and United Kingdom). Hence this evolution must have deeper political and intellectual roots.</p></li>

Not only does the absence of Wednesday classes do particular harm to the least advantaged students, the system also has very negative effects on professional equality between men and women. See C.

Communist deputies also played a key role in reinforcing the progressivity of the income tax by eliminating the deduction for the previous year’s tax payment. On these debates in 1945, see T.

In parliamentary debates in 1907–1908, Caillaux strenuously defended the idea of a neutral tax on overall income so that “executives of large corporations” would not be treated more favorably than “humble craftsmen” and “humble merchants.” He even said that “the schoolteacher, tax collector, and railway employee are often rich in the eyes of the small farmer or small businessman.” See Piketty, <i>Top Incomes in France,</i> pp. 212–213.</p></li>

A few months later, he founded the Union for the Defense of Merchants and Craftsmen (UDCA). Poujadist agitation reached its peak in 1954–1955, with multiple “commando operations” intended to assist small businessmen facing bankruptcy owing to the voracity of the tax collectors. The UDCA declared a “tax strike” in January 1955, and in the January 1956 elections the movement achieved its highest score (leading to the formation of a sizable Poujadist parliamentary group, including Jean-Marie Le Pen). The Poujadists attacked measures that favored workers, especially “Parisian managers,” which in their eyes proved that the “modernizing central government” and its “heartless technocrats,” regardless of political label, did not care about the fate of small independent producers. None of this should be allowed to distract from Poujade’s very real anti-Semitism, which was caricatured in the “Poujadolf” cover of <i>L’Express,</i> a weekly magazine much read by Parisian managers and highly educated wage earners at the time.</p></li>

The increase of the share of Muslim voters from barely 0.5 percent in 1988 to roughly 5 percent in 2012 and 2012 is highly significant, however.</p></li>

See H. El Karoui, <i>L’Islam, une religion française</i> (Gallimard, 2018), pp. 20–26.

The other pillar of French nationality law is the so-called double <i>jus solis</i> instituted in 1851: any person born in France of parents born in France automatically becomes a French citizen at birth.

Mentioning participation in the Muslim scouts causes response rates to drop sharply, while participating in the Catholic or Protestant scouts causes them to rise. Jewish names are also discriminated against but much less so than Muslim names. The study is based on 6,000 representative jobs in small and medium businesses. See M. A.

The decrease in anti-immigrant sentiment between the period 1985–2000 (70–75 percent) and 2000–2020 (50–60 percent) is partly due to generational change and the rise of antiracist movements. It would be a mistake to think that it has to do with lower salience for the issue of immigration.

<li role="doc-endnote"><p class="FN"><span class="fn_tx"><a href="#footnote-1335-backlink" id="footnote-1335">127</a></span>.  In 1986 the right abolished the tax on large fortunes (<i>impôt sur les grandes fortunes</i> or IGF), which the left had passed in 1981. But losing the 1988 presidential election convinced the parties of the right that it would be unwise to attack this popular tax when the left reinstated it in 1990 under a new name, <i>impôt sur la fortune</i> (ISF). In 2007, however, Nicolas Sarkozy enacted a so-called tax shield (a ceiling on the total amount a taxpayer with a given income could be asked to pay). The effect of this was to exempt many of the rich from much of the burden of the ISF. But Sarkozy had to rescind this unpopular measure a few months before the 2012 elections while at the same time sharply reducing the rates of the ISF (the top rate, applicable to fortunes above 17 million euros, was decreased from 1.8 to 0.5 percent). This measure never went into effect: the Socialist government, elected in 2012, partially restored rates to their previous levels. The top rate was nevertheless reduced to 1.5 percent on fortunes above 10 million euros on the grounds that interest rates had fallen. The argument is odd, since large fortunes are not invested in sovereign bonds, and their rate of increase indicates much higher rates of return (see <a href="chapter_13.xhtml">Chap. 13</a>, <a href="chapter_13.xhtml#tab13-1">Table 13.1</a>).</p></li>

In the US context, they may be blacks. The Democratic Party, which had been the party of slavery, redefined itself in the late nineteenth and first half of the twentieth centuries as a social-nativist party: more social and egalitarian than the Republicans with respect to the white population (especially white immigrants from Europe, such as Irish and Italians) but aggressively segregationist toward blacks; see <a href="chapter_6.xhtml">Chap. 6</a>.

<li role="doc-endnote"><p class="FN"><span class="fn_tx"><a href="#footnote-1323-backlink" id="footnote-1323">140</a></span>.  Recent work has shown that tax competition alone can result in a substantial loss of income and well-being (10–20 percent depending on the estimates) for the poorest 50 percent of Europeans. See M. Munoz, “How Much Are the Poor Losing from Tax Competition? Estimating the Welfare Effects of Fiscal Dumping in Europe,” WID.world, 2019. It is very difficult (if not impossible) to say whether this loss is greater or smaller than the gains due to trade integration, especially since those gains vary greatly from sector to sector and depend on whether one’s position is more that of a worker or a consumer. As for possible gains from financial integration, the available studies suggest much smaller benefits (less than 1 percent of national income). See P. O. Gourinchas and O. Jeanne, “The Elusive Gains from International Financial Integration,” <i>Review of Economic Studies,</i> 2006.</p></li>

<li role="doc-endnote"><p class="FN"><span class="fn_tx"><a href="#footnote-1316-backlink" id="footnote-1316">147</a></span>.  For a detailed analysis of the various sources available for measuring the evolution of the French wealth distribution, see B. Garbinti, J. Goupille-Lebret, and T. Piketty, “Accounting for Wealth Inequality Dynamics: Methods and Estimates for France,” WID.world, 2017. Data from wealth declarations indicate trends similar to those found in declarations of income and inheritances. It is important, however, to point out that very little public information has been released about the ISF since its creation because political leaders and bureaucrats want to maintain a monopoly over information they deem to be sensitive. In addition, the upper ranks of the French ministries of economy and finance have evinced a certain hostility to the wealth tax on principle.</p></li>

<li role="doc-endnote"><p class="FN"><span class="fn_tx"><a href="#footnote-1313-backlink" id="footnote-1313">150</a></span>.  Note that the Hollande government elected in 2012 (partially) restored the ISF rates that Sarkozy had cut but never rescinded the decision of the previous government to raise the threshold of the ISF from 0.8 to 1.3 million euros and to eliminate the detailed reporting requirement under 3 million euros. Since then, wealth of 1.3–3 million euros (about half of those subject to the tax) simply indicate a figure for aggregate wealth, which the tax authorities have no way of checking. The contrast with the pre-filled forms system of income taxes (especially for wage earners) is striking. The refusal to set up a system of pre-filled wealth tax forms while the Socialists were in power (2012–2017) is especially surprising, because the government quickly found itself enmeshed in the Cahuzac affair, named for the Socialist minister of the budget, J<span class="fn_accent">é</span>r<span class="fn_accent">ô</span>me Cahuzac, who avoided the wealth tax by failing to declare his Swiss bank accounts (uncovered by diligent journalists, not by the tax authorities). One might have expected that this would lead to efforts to make the system more transparent and to pre-filled statements.</p></li>
